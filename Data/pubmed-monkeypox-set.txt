TI  - Genomic history of human monkey pox infections in the Central African Republic 
      between 2001 and 2018.

AB  - Monkeypox is an emerging infectious disease, which has a clinical presentation 
      similar to smallpox. In the two past decades, Central Africa has seen an increase 
      in the frequency of cases, with many monkeypox virus (MPXV) isolates detected in 
      the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR). To 
      date, no complete MPXV viral genome has been published from the human cases 
      identified in the CAR. The objective of this study was to sequence the full 
      genome of 10 MPXV isolates collected during the CAR epidemics between 2001 and 
      2018 in order to determine their phylogenetic relationships among MPXV lineages 
      previously described in Central Africa and West Africa. Our phylogenetic results 
      indicate that the 10 CAR isolates belong to three lineages closely related to 
      those found in DRC. The phylogenetic pattern shows that all of them emerged in 
      the rainforest block of the Congo Basin. Since most human index cases in CAR 
      occurred at the northern edge of western and eastern rainforests, transmissions 
      from wild animals living in the rainforest is the most probable hypothesis. In 
      addition, molecular dating estimates suggest that periods of intense political 
      instability resulting in population movements within the country often associated 
      also with increased poverty may have led to more frequent contact with host wild 
      animals. The CAR socio-economic situation, armed conflicts and ecological 
      disturbances will likely incite populations to interact more and more with wild 
      animals and thus increase the risk of zoonotic spillover.

AB  - The recent emergence of monkey pox in the United States of America highlights the 
      problem (known for other infectious agents) of dissemination of pathogens outside 
      their endemic area, and of subsequent global threats of variable gravity 
      according to agents. It is a real emergency since monkey pox had been confined to 
      Africa for several decades, where small epidemics occurred from time to time, 
      monkey pox is a "miniature smallpox" which, in Africa, evolves on an endemic 
      (zoonotic) mode with, as reservoirs, several species of wild rodents (mainly 
      squirrels) and some monkey species. It can be accidentally transmitted to man 
      then develops as epidemics, sometimes leading to death. The virus was imported in 
      2003 in the United States of America, via Gambia rats and wild squirrels (all 
      African species), and infected prairie dogs (which are now in fashion as pets), 
      then crossed the species barrier to man. In the United States of America, 
      screening campaigns, epidemiological investigations, and subsequent treatments 
      led to a rapid control of the epidemic, which is a model of emergent disease for 
      this country. Therapeutic and preventive measures directly applicable to monkey 
      pox are discussed. They can also be applied against other pox virus infections 
      (including smallpox). The risk of criminal introduction of pox viruses is 
      discussed since it is, more than ever, a real worldwide threat.

AB  - Recently, concern has been raised about the emergence of human monkeypox virus 
      and the occasionally severe clinical presentation bearing resemblance to that of 
      smallpox. In 2018 3 patients in the UK were diagnosed with monkeypox, and the 
      frequency and geographic distribution of cases across West and Central Africa 
      have increased in recent years. In Nigeria, most monkeypox patients are aged 
      <40 years and lack cross-protective immunity because they were born after 
      discontinuation of the smallpox eradication campaign. This article reviews the 
      epidemiology, clinical features, and management of monkeypox and discusses its 
      growing public health threat in this context.

AB  - Monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, results in a 
      smallpox-like disease in humans. Since monkeypox in humans was initially 
      diagnosed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), it has spread to 
      other regions of Africa (primarily West and Central), and cases outside Africa 
      have emerged in recent years. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed 
      and grey literature on how monkeypox epidemiology has evolved, with particular 
      emphasis on the number of confirmed, probable, and/or possible cases, age at 
      presentation, mortality, and geographical spread. The review is registered with 
      PROSPERO (CRD42020208269). We identified 48 peer-reviewed articles and 18 grey 
      literature sources for data extraction. The number of human monkeypox cases has 
      been on the rise since the 1970s, with the most dramatic increases occurring in 
      the DRC. The median age at presentation has increased from 4 (1970s) to 21 years 
      (2010-2019). There was an overall case fatality rate of 8.7%, with a significant 
      difference between clades-Central African 10.6% (95% CI: 8.4%- 13.3%) vs. West 
      African 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%- 6.8%). Since 2003, import- and travel-related spread 
      outside of Africa has occasionally resulted in outbreaks. Interactions/activities 
      with infected animals or individuals are risk behaviors associated with acquiring 
      monkeypox. Our review shows an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the 
      highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from 
      young children to young adults. These findings may be related to the cessation of 
      smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, 
      leading to increased human-to-human transmission. The appearance of outbreaks 
      beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease. Increased 
      surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases are essential tools for 
      understanding the continuously changing epidemiology of this resurging disease.

TI  - Monkeypox Virus in Nigeria: Infection Biology, Epidemiology, and Evolution.
LID - 10.3390/v12111257 [doi]

AB  - Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is a 
      member of orthopoxvirus genus. The reemergence of MPXV in 2017 (at Bayelsa state) 
      after 39 years of no reported case in Nigeria, and the export of travelers' 
      monkeypox (MPX) from Nigeria to other parts of the world, in 2018 and 2019, 
      respectively, have raised concern that MPXV may have emerged to occupy the 
      ecological and immunological niche vacated by smallpox virus. This review X-rays 
      the current state of knowledge pertaining the infection biology, epidemiology, 
      and evolution of MPXV in Nigeria and worldwide, especially with regard to the 
      human, cellular, and viral factors that modulate the virus transmission dynamics, 
      infection, and its maintenance in nature. This paper also elucidates the role of 
      recombination, gene loss and gene gain in MPXV evolution, chronicles the role of 
      signaling in MPXV infection, and reviews the current therapeutic options 
      available for the treatment and prevention of MPX. Additionally, genome-wide 
      phylogenetic analysis was undertaken, and we show that MPXV isolates from recent 
      2017 outbreak in Nigeria were monophyletic with the isolate exported to Israel 
      from Nigeria but do not share the most recent common ancestor with isolates 
      obtained from earlier outbreaks, in 1971 and 1978, respectively. Finally, the 
      review highlighted gaps in knowledge particularly the non-identification of a 
      definitive reservoir host animal for MPXV and proposed future research endeavors 
      to address the unresolved questions.

AB  - Human monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus with a presentation similar to 
      smallpox. Clinical differentiation of the disease from smallpox and varicella is 
      difficult. Laboratory diagnostics are principal components to identification and 
      surveillance of disease, and new tests are needed for a more precise and rapid 
      diagnosis. The majority of human infections occur in Central Africa, where 
      surveillance in rural areas with poor infrastructure is difficult but can be 
      accomplished with evidence-guided tools and educational materials to inform 
      public health workers of important principles. Contemporary epidemiological 
      studies are needed now that populations do not receive routine smallpox 
      vaccination. New therapeutics and vaccines offer hope for the treatment and 
      prevention of monkeypox; however, more research must be done before they are 
      ready to be deployed in an endemic setting. There is a need for more research in 
      the epidemiology, ecology, and biology of the virus in endemic areas to better 
      understand and prevent human infections.

TI  - Human Monkey Pox Virus Infection in Plateau State, North Central Nigeria: A 
      Report of Two Cases.
PG  - 1242-1246
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human Monkey Pox Virus (HMPV) infection is a zoonotic infection that 
      is endemic in the Congo basin and West Africa. Its similarity to smallpox 
      infection, increased susceptibility infection in human populations, lack of a 
      definitive therapy and its potential for use as a bioterrorism tool underscores 
      its public health importance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of HMPV 
      infection in Plateau State, North Central Nigeria. METHODS: This was a case study 
      of HMPV infection occurring in two Nigerian adults, seen in 2018, at Bingham 
      University Teaching Hospital in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. The cases involved 
      two siblings, and these were the first reported cases in Plateau State of 
      Nigeria, which has an estimated population of 3.5 million persons. The diagnosis 
      was based on a combination of clinical features and positive PCR tests on samples 
      from the skin lesions and blood. RESULTS: The first case, a 20-year-old male, 
      presented with a one week history of fever, headache, pain on swallowing and 
      micturition, and generalised skin lesions. The second case is a 20 year old step 
      brother of the first case, and the primary care provider to first case when he 
      took ill. He also presented with a one-week history of fever, headache, pain on 
      swallowing, and skin lesions which were less intense than in the first case. PCR 
      assays of samples from the skin lesions and blood were positive in both cases. 
      The other comorbidity in both cases was pharyngotonsillitis. Blood, throat, 
      stool, and urine cultures for suspected sepsis and urinary tract infection were 
      all negative. Both cases were admitted and discharged after receiving a course of 
      antibiotics, antihistamine, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, and 
      multivitamins. Universal precautions were observed. CONCLUSION: HMPV infection in 
      our environment underscores the need to strengthen preventive health strategies 
      against this infection.

AB  - Healthcare-associated transmission of monkeypox has been observed on multiple 
      occasions in areas where the disease is endemic. Data collected by the US Centers 
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from an ongoing CDC-supported program of 
      enhanced surveillance in the Tshuapa Province of the Democratic Republic of the 
      Congo, where the annual incidence of human monkeypox is estimated to be 
      3.5-5/10,000, suggests that there is approximately one healthcare worker 
      infection for every 100 confirmed monkeypox cases. Herein, we describe a study 
      that commenced in February 2017, the intent of which is to evaluate the 
      effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of a third-generation smallpox vaccine, 
      IMVAMUNE(®), in healthcare personnel at risk of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection. 
      We describe procedures for documenting exposures to monkeypox virus infection in 
      study participants, and outline lessons learned that may be of relevance for 
      studies of other investigational medical countermeasures in hard to reach, 
      under-resourced populations.

TI  - Detection of monkeypox virus with real-time PCR assays.
PG  - 194-203
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human monkeypox, a zoonotic disease, was first reported outside of 
      Africa during the 2003 US outbreak. OBJECTIVES: We present two real-time PCR 
      assays critical for laboratory diagnosis of monkeypox during the 2003 US 
      outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: A TaqMan-based assay (E9L-NVAR) targets the orthopoxvirus 
      DNA polymerase gene and detects Eurasian orthopoxviruses other than Variola. A 
      hybridization assay, utilizing a MGB Eclipsetrade mark (Epoch Biosciences) probe, 
      targets an envelope protein gene (B6R) and specifically detects monkeypox virus 
      (MPXV). Assays were validated using coded orthopoxvirus DNA samples and used to 
      evaluate lesion samples from five confirmed US monkeypox cases. RESULTS: E9L-NVAR 
      did not detect variola (48 strains), North American orthopoxviruses (2), or DNA 
      derived from non-poxviral rash illnesses. The assay reproducibly identified 
      various concentrations of 13 Eurasian orthopoxvirus strains and was sensitive to 
      12.5 vaccinia genomes. The B6R assay recognized 15 different MPXV strains, while 
      other orthopoxvirus (9) and bacteria (15) strains did not cross-react. Of the 13 
      human samples tested from confirmed cases, both assays identified 100% as 
      containing MPXV DNA. CONCLUSIONS: E9L-NVAR and B6R assays demonstrate 100% 
      specificity for non-variola Eurasian orthopoxvirus and MPXV, respectively. Using 
      two discrete viral gene targets, these assays together provide a reliable and 
      sensitive method for quickly confirming monkeypox infections.
