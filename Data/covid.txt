AB  - INTRODUCTION: We examined the potential impact of COVID-19 on trends in volumesales of non-cigarette combustible and smokeless tobacco products in the U.S.METHODS: We analyzed monthly national sales for cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe, and roll-your-own tobacco during June 2019-June 2021. Data were from the U.SDepartment of the Treasury. Interrupted time series were used to measureassociations of the COVID-19 "shock" (taken as June 2020 or 6 months after thefirst diagnosis of COVID-19 in the US) and volume sales. Negative binomialregression was used to evaluate associations between volume sales and changes in community mobility. RESULTS: Within interrupted time series analysis, the shockof the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an initial increase in the number oflittle cigars sold by 11.43 million sticks (p<0.01), with no significantsustained change in trend. The COVID-19 shock was also associated with an initialincrease in large cigar volume sales by 59.02 million sticks, followed by asubsequent decrease by 32.57 million sticks per month (p=0.005). Every 10%reduction in mobility to retail stores was significantly associated with reduced volume sales of little cigars (IRR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98) and large cigars(IRR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96). Other findings were statisticallynon-significant. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was associated with increased volume sales for cigars and there was a significant association between reduced mobility topoints of sale and reduced cigar volume sales. Intensified efforts are needed to prioritize evidence-based tobacco prevention and control efforts amidst thepandemic. IMPLICATIONS: At the six-month mark following the start of the COVID-19pandemic in the US, we found that the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic wasassociated with a statistically significant initial increase in the number oflittle and large cigars sold nationwide.These COVID-19 related trends may havemomentarily reversed the long-term declines seen in cigar sales prior to thepandemic.Intensified implementation of evidence-based tobacco control andprevention measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may help reduce aggregatetobacco consumption.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe effectiveness of mRNA vaccines by comparing 2-dose (2D)and 3-dose (3D) healthcare worker (HCW) recipients in the setting of Omicronvariant dominance. Performance of 2D and 3D vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2variants and the clinical outcomes of HCWs may inform return-to-work guidance.METHODS: In a retrospective study from December 15, 2020 - January 15, 2022, SARSCoV-2 infections among HCWs at a large tertiary cancer center in New York City(NYC) were examined to estimate infection rates over the omicron period(aggregated positive tests/person-days) and 95% CIs in 2D and 3D mRNA vaccinated HCWs and were compared using rate ratios. We describe the clinical features ofpost-vaccine infections and impact of prior (pre-Omicron) COVID infection onvaccine effectiveness (VE). RESULTS: Among the 20,857 HCWs in our cohort, 20,660 completed the 2D series with an mRNA vaccine during our study period and 12,461had received a third dose by January 15, 2022. The infection rate ratio for 2Dvs. 3D vaccinated HCWs was 0.667 (95% CI 0.623, 0.713) for an estimated 3D VE of 33.2% compared to 2 doses only during the Omicron dominant period from 12/15/21- 1/15/22. Breakthrough (BT) Omicron infections after 3D + 14 days occurred in 1315HCWs. Omicron infections were mild, with 16% of 3D and 11% 2D HCWs beingasymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Study demonstrates improved vaccine-derived protectionagainst COVID-19 infection in 3D vs. 2D mRNA vaccinees during the Omicron surge. The advantage of 3D vaccination was maintained irrespective of prior COVID-19infection status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of olfactory disorder (OD) in patients with COVID-19 isunclear. Our study aimed to elucidate the relationships between inflammatoryfactors and OD in a sample of Omicron-infected patients with a high rate ofvaccination in China. METHODS: The Sniffin' Sticks 12-item test (SST-12) wasperformed in a cross-sectional study of 148 recovered Omicron-infected patientsto evaluate OD severity. We compared demographic, laboratory, and clinical data. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight Omicron-infected patients were enrolled. Onehundred twenty-nine cases of OD were detected. Increased inflammation contributedto OD severity, especially in the adult group. OD was shown to be aggravated byan increase in IL-6 levels. The adjusted odds ratio was 2.22 (95% CI: 0.98-5.05, P=0.056) after adjustment for age, sex and vaccine characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that the prevalence of OD remains high in vaccinatedOmicron-infected patients and that SST-12 might be a feasible method to screenfor OD. IL-6 may play a role in the biochemical and pathological processesunderlying OD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: . SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has shown reduced infection severity;however, the reinfection frequency amongst unvaccinated, partially vaccinated andfully vaccinated remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the rates andassociated factors for such occurrences. METHODS: . This retrospectiveepidemiological report included 1362 COVID-19 reinfection cases in Bahrainbetween April 2020 and July 2021. We analysed differences in disease severity andreinfection characteristics between various vaccination statuses; fullyvaccinated, interrupted vaccination, one vaccination dose, post-reinfectionvaccination and unvaccinated. RESULTS: . Reinfection cases increased from zerocases per month in April - June 2020 to a sharp peak of 579 reinfection cases in May 2021. Males constituted a significantly larger proportion of reinfections(60.3%, p<0.0001). Reinfection episodes were highest amongst the 30-39 years ofage (29.7%). The least reinfection episodes occurred at 3-6 months after thefirst infection (20.6%) and most occurred >/=9 months after initial infection(46.4%). Most individuals were asymptomatic during both episodes (35.7%),Reinfection disease severity was mild, with vaccinated patients less likely tohave symptomatic reinfection (OR 0.71, p=0.004). Only 6.6% reinfection casesrequired hospitalization. One death was recorded, corresponding to unvaccinatedgroup. CONCLUSION: . Vaccine-induced immunity and prior infection with or withoutvaccination were effective in reducing reinfection disease severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines excluded individualswith active reproductive needs (attempting to conceive, currently pregnant,and/or lactating). Women comprise three-quarters of healthcare workers in theUnited States, an occupational field among the first to receive the vaccine.Professional medical and government organizations encouraged shareddecision-making and access to vaccination among those with active reproductiveneeds. OBJECTIVE: To characterize information sources used by pregnancy-capablehealthcare workers for information about the COVID-19 vaccines, and to comparethe self-reported "most important" source by respondents' active reproductiveneeds, if any. STUDY DESIGN: This was a web-based national survey of female,US-based healthcare workers in January 2021. Recruitment was conducted usingsocial media and subsequent sharing via word of mouth. We classified respondents into six groups based on self-reported reproductive needs: 1) preventingpregnancy, 2) attempting pregnancy, 3) currently pregnant, 4) lactating, 5)attempting pregnancy and lactating, and 6) currently pregnant and lactating. Weprovided respondents with a list of information sources (friends, family, OB-GYN,pediatrician, news, social media, government organizations, their employer, and"other") and asked respondents which source(s) they used when looking forinformation about the vaccine, and their most important source. We useddescriptive statistics to characterize the information sources and compared theendorsement of government organizations and OB-GYN as the most importantinformation source between reproductive groups using chi-square. Effect size was calculated using Cramer's V. RESULTS: Our survey had 11,405 unique respondents:5,846 (51.3%) were preventing pregnancy, 955 (8.4%) were attempting pregnancy,2,196 (19.3%) were currently pregnant, 2,250 (19.7%) were lactating, 67 (0.6%)were attempting pregnancy and lactating, and 91 (0.8%) were currently pregnantand lactating. The most endorsed information sources were governmentorganizations (88.7%), employers (48.5%), OB-GYN (44.9%), and social media(39.6%). For the most important information source, the distribution ofrespondents endorsing government organizations was different between reproductivegroups (p<0.001), most common among respondents preventing pregnancy (62.6%) and least common among those currently pregnant (31.5%). We observed an inversepattern among respondents endorsing an OB-GYN as the most important source: thesource was most common among currently pregnant respondents (51.4%) and leastcommon among those preventing pregnancy (5.8%), p<0.001. The difference inendorsement of social media as an information source between groups wassignificant but had a small effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers usegovernment and professional medical organizations for information. Respondentsattempting pregnancy, pregnant, and/or lactating are more likely to use socialmedia and an OB-GYN as information sources for vaccine decision-making. This datacan inform public health messaging and counseling for clinicians.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 related placentitis shows distinctive histological characteristics andits impact on perinatal outcomes is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Wepresent two such cases in the third trimester, following mild maternal clinicalsymptoms and associated with maternal coagulopathy, reduced fetal movements andnon-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Both cases resulted in emergencycesarean deliveries. Our cases and a review of the literature highlight thatSARS-CoV-2 undermines placental function and thus greatly impacts late-termpregnancies, even in the absence of severe systemic disease.w.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sonographers performing venous duplex ultrasounds (VDUS) in COVID-19 patients are placed at an increased risk for exposure due to close contact withthese patients for an extended time period. The objective of this study was toevaluate the efficacy of a modified COVID-19 VDUS protocol in reducingsonographer exposure to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a single centerretrospective review. Subjects who underwent a VDUS under the modified COVID-19protocol between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with a confirmed or presumedCOVID-19 diagnosis at the time of VDUS were included. The modified COVID-19protocol was defined as the ability of the sonographer to terminate theexamination upon detection of an acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The primary outcome measures were the number of anatomic deep venous segments recorded by thesonographer, used as a surrogate measure for sonographer exposure time, and thenumber of acute DVTs on follow-up examinations in segments not visualized onindex VDUS. RESULTS: One hundred sixty lower extremity venous duplex ultrasounds (LEVDUS) and 72 upper extremity venous duplex ultrasounds (UEVDUS) were performedusing the COVID-19 protocol. On index VDUS, 27.5% (44/160) of subjects whounderwent LEVDUS and 36.6% (26/72) of subjects who underwent UEVDUS had an acute DVT. On follow-up imaging 17.9% (7/38) of LEVDUS and 10% (1/10) of UEVDUSdemonstrated a new acute DVT. Malignancy and surgery 30 days prior to imagingwere significantly associated with acute lower extremity DVTs, while mechanicalventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were associated withacute upper extremity DVTs. On index DUS, there were averages of 10.6 of 14 totalvisualized segments on LEVDUS and 6.4 of 10 total segments on UEVDUS. In totalindex VDUS, 35.6% of LEVDUS and 78.6% of UEVDUS were abbreviated. Index VDUS thatwere positive for acute DVT had significantly fewer visualized segments for both lower (8.4 vs 11.5, p<0.0001) and upper extremities (4.2 vs 7.6, p<0.0001). Onfollow up examination, only 1 out of 8 new acute DVTs occurred in a subject whoseindex VDUS was abbreviated, and the corresponding segment not assessed. Thisfinding did not impact the subject's clinical course. CONCLUSION: The modifiedCOVID-19 VDUS protocol reduced sonographers' potential exposure time to COVID-19.Additionally, the clinical efficacy was maintained, with no missed DVTs despitethe abbreviation of VDUS examinations.

AB  - The recent surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations severely challenges healthcaresystems around the globe and has increased the demand for reliable testspredictive of disease severity and mortality. Using multiplexed targeted massspectrometry assays on a robust triple quadrupole MS setup which is available in many clinical laboratories, we determined the precise concentrations of 100s ofproteins and metabolites in plasma from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Weobserved a clear distinction between COVID-19 patients and controls and,strikingly, a significant difference between survivors and non-survivors. Withincreasing length of hospitalization, the survivors' samples showed a trendtowards normal concentrations, indicating a potential sensitive readout oftreatment success. Building a machine learning multi-omic model that considersthe concentrations of ten proteins and five metabolites we could predict patient survival with 92% accuracy (AUC 0.97) on the day of hospitalization. Hence, ourstandardized assays represent a unique opportunity for the early stratificationof hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Angiotensin (Ang) II, the main active member of the renin angiotensin system(RAS), is essential for the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. However,hyperactivation of the RAS causes fibrotic diseases. Angiotensin (Ang) II haspro-inflammatory actions, and moreover activates interstitial fibroblasts and/or dysregulates extracellular matrix degradation. The discovery of new RAS pathways has revealed the complexity of this system. Among the RAS peptides, alamandine(ALA, Ala(1) Ang 1-7) has been identified in humans, rats, and mice, withprotective actions in different pathological conditions. ALA has similar effects to its well-known congener, Ang-(1-7), as a vasodilator, anti-inflammatory, andantifibrotic. Its protective role against cardiovascular diseases iswell-reviewed in the literature. However, the protective actions of ALA infibrotic conditions have been little explored. Therefore, in this article, wereview the ability of ALA to modulate the inflammatory process and collagendeposition, to serve as an antioxidant, and to mediate protection againstfunctional disorders. In this scenario, we also explore ALA as a promisingtherapy for pulmonary fibrosis after COVID-19 infection.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) has influenced resource use and how peopleinteract with their environment, with changing priorities and competing publichealth factors affecting pro-environmental behaviours at individual, societal,business and political levels. We used data from an online plastic footprintcalculator to explore temporal changes, purchasing patterns and consumerbehaviours around on-the-go plastic use during the pandemic. We hypothesised that1) people's plastic use when on-the-go would change in response to the pandemicand related government restrictions and; 2) single-use plastic use on-the-gowould decrease during lockdown periods due to restrictions against leaving home. The calculator received 1937 responses, with 13,544 plastic items recorded. Most used were food wrappers (54% of all items), takeaway containers (12%) and bottles(9%). Six out of seven items showed increased use during lockdowns, in-line with our first hypothesis, but not the second. Three times more bottles were used,food wrapper consumption almost doubled, and takeaway container use more thandoubled. Increased container use occurred alongside increased takeaway mealconsumption during lockdowns. Patterns were similar between different periods of lockdown, with no significant differences in the number used of any items, orpercentage of respondents using them. Results indicate that during lockdown,people found it harder to avoid single-use plastic while on-the-go, supportingevidence from other studies that plastic use can be driven by perceptions ofhygiene benefits and lack of "safe" alternatives. Our results indicateopportunities to reduce single-use plastic consumption and we provide examples ofsuccessful implementation. Our findings evidence that, when properly applied,government-led guidance can effectively support consumer choices for reducedplastic use, encourage use of reusables, increase provision of alternatives, and dispel hygiene myths. The sudden increase in plastic waste due to the Covid-19pandemic amplifies the need to substantiate plastic reduction policy promiseswithout further delay.

AB  - The input of SARS-CoV-2 or its fragments into freshwater ecosystems (via domesticor hospital sewage) has raised concerns about its possible impacts on aquaticorganisms. Thus, using mayfly larvae [Cloeon dipterum (L.), Ephemeroptera:Baetidae] as a model system, we aimed to evaluate the possible effects of thecombined short exposure of SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides (named PSPD-2001,PSPD-2002, and PSPD-2003 - at 266.2ng/L) with multiple emerging pollutants atambient concentrations. After six days of exposure, we observed higher mortality of larvae exposed to SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides (alone or in combination withthe pollutant mix) and a lower-body condition index than those unexposed larvae. In the "PSPD" and "Mix+PSPD" groups, the activity of superoxide dismutase,catalase, DPPH radical scavenging activity, and the total thiol levels were also lower than in the "control" group. In addition, we evidenced the induction ofnitrosative stress (inferred by increased nitrite production) and reducedacetylcholinesterase activity by SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides. On the other hand, malondialdehyde levels in larvae exposed to treatments were significantly lowerthan in unexposed larvae. The values of the integrated biomarker response indexand the principal component analysis (PCA) results confirmed the similaritybetween the responses of animals exposed to SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides (aloneand in combination with the pollutant mix). Although viral peptides did notintensify the effects of the pollutant mix, our study sheds light on thepotential ecotoxicological risk associated with the spread of the new coronavirusin aquatic environments. Therefore, we recommend exploring this topic in otherorganisms and experimental contexts.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 Omicron rapidly outcompeted other variants and currently dominates theCOVID-19 pandemic. Its enhanced transmission and immune evasion are thought to bedriven by numerous mutations in the Omicron Spike protein. Here, wesystematically introduced BA.1 and/or BA.2 Omicron Spike mutations into theancestral Spike protein and examined the impacts on Spike function, processing,and susceptibility to neutralization. Individual mutations of S371F/L, S375F, andT376A in the ACE2-receptor-binding domain as well as Q954H and N969K in the hingeregion 1 impaired infectivity, while changes to G339D, D614G, N764K, and L981Fmoderately enhanced it. Most mutations in the N-terminal region andreceptor-binding domain reduced the sensitivity of the Spike protein toneutralization by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine and by therapeutic antibodies. Our results represent a systematic functional analysisof Omicron Spike adaptations that have allowed this SARS-CoV-2 variant todominate the current pandemic.

AB  - We studied the prevalent cytotoxic CD8 T cell response mounted against severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein269-277epitope (sequence YLQPRTFLL) via the most frequent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I worldwide, HLA A( *)02. The Spike P272L mutation that has arisen in atleast 112 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages to date, including in lineages classifiedas "variants of concern," was not recognized by the large CD8 T cell responseseen across cohorts of HLA A( *)02(+) convalescent patients and individualsvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, despite these responses comprising of over 175different individual T cell receptors. Viral escape at prevalent T cell epitopes restricted by high frequency HLAs may be particularly problematic when vaccineimmunity is focused on a single protein such as SARS-CoV-2 Spike, providing astrong argument for inclusion of multiple viral proteins in next generationvaccines and highlighting the need for monitoring T cell escape in new SARS-CoV-2variants.

AB  - We use national birth data to assess the associations between the COVID-19pandemic during 2020 and birth outcomes in Uruguay. Employing interrupted timeseries difference-in-differences techniques, we find mixed results, with somepregnancies showing increases in the likelihood of very preterm orvery-low-weight births, and some others showing decreases in the incidence ofmoderate prematurity and moderate low birth weight. Adverse outcomes are morelikely among women with low education, women with previous children, and withrisk factors, such as smoking or being older than 34. We observe improvements in health at birth for children of non-smokers, women younger than 35, and womenwith no other children. We underscore the role of health care by showing thatwomen in the private sector, who suffered the strongest contraction inface-to-face prenatal care use, experienced more adverse birth outcomes. Ourresults also suggest that the economic recession and an increased burden ofchildcare were behind the increases in preterm and very-low-weight births.Because pollution is an unlikely channel for the positive results, we hypothesizethat for some pregnancies, the pandemic improved the intrauterine habitat byleading to a quieter and healthier lifestyle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive complaints are one of the most frequent symptoms reportedin post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) has been used to estimate prevalence of cognitive impairment in manystudies of PASC, and is commonly employed as a screening test in this population,however, its validity has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To determine theutility of the MoCA to screen for cognitive impairment in PASC. METHODS: Sixtyparticipants underwent neuropsychological, psychiatric, and medical assessments, as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 6-8 months after acute COVID-19infection. RESULTS: The overall sample had a mean score of 26.1 on the MoCA, withapproximately one third screening below the cutoff score of 26, similar to therate of extremely low NP test performance. MoCA score was inversely correlatedwith fatigue and depression measures and ethnic minority participants scored onaverage lower, despite similar education and estimated premorbid function. TheMoCA had an accuracy of 63.3% at detecting any degree of diminished NPperformance, and an accuracy of 73.3% at detecting extremely low NP performance. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The MoCA may not be accurate for detecting neither mildnor more severe degrees of diminished NP test performance in PASC. Therefore,patients with persistent cognitive complaints in the setting of PASC who score inthe normal range on the MoCA should be referred for formal NP assessment.

AB  - Cardiovascular involvement is a common complication of COVID-19 infection and is associated to increased risk of unfavorable outcome. Advanced imaging modalities (coronary CT angiography and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance) play a crucial role inthe diagnosis, follow-up and risk stratification of patients affected by COVID-19pneumonia with suspected cardiovascular involvement. In the present manuscript wefirstly review current knowledge on the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 cantrigger endothelial and myocardial damage. Secondly, the implications of thecardiovascular damage on patient's prognosis are presented. Finally, we providean overview of the main findings at advanced cardiac imaging characterizingCOVID-19 in the acute setting, in the post-acute syndrome, and after vaccination,emphasizing the potentiality of CT and CMR, the indication and their clinicalimplications.

AB  - Studies conducted during the COVID-19 Pandemic have reported increased rates ofmental illnesses including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD) [1]. A common symptom of mental illness is change in Rapid EyeMovement (REM) sleep, the phase of sleep associated with dreaming and nightmares.The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects ofsystemic stress on nightmares. In this study, we investigate whether the COVID-19pandemic affects nightmare frequency and content using a web-based survey within the state of New Mexico. The survey returned 197 responses showing an increase inthe quantity of both bad dreams and nightmares. Furthermore, significant changes in nightmare themes were reported compared to relative rates prior to thepandemic (RR 1,42, p < 0.01; RR 5, p < 0.001). This novel data supports thatincreased stress from the COVID-19 pandemic has altered dream and nightmarecontent and frequency.

AB  - The use of data has been essential throughout the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. Wehave needed it to populate our models, inform our understanding, and shape ourresponses to the disease. However, data has not always been easy to find andaccess, it has varied in quality and coverage, been difficult to reuse orrepurpose. This paper reviews these and other challenges and recommends steps to develop a data ecosystem better able to deal with future pandemics by bettersupporting preparedness, prevention, detection and response.

AB  - After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many office workers transitioned toworking-from-home (WFH) which altered routine physical activity (PA). Tounderstand how these workers' PA were affected throughout the pandemic, PA datacollected in January, April, June, and December 2020 with an activity tracker anda validated survey were analyzed. Between January and December, it was found thatstep counts during the weekday decreased (p < 0.01), weekday heart rate washigher than weekends (p < 0.01), activity-tracker and self-reported PA decreased (p < 0.01), and sitting time increased (p < 0.01). To understand the agreementbetween the objective and subjective METs, Bland-Altman analyses were completedand demonstrated an acceptable level of agreement. Findings show decreased level of PA amongst WFH office workers and that the activity tracker and survey arereliable methods of recording WFH PA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autopsy studies have provided valuable insights into thepathophysiology of COVID-19. Controversies remain about whether the clinicalpresentation is due to direct organ damage by SARS-CoV-2 or secondary effects,such as overshooting immune response. SARS-CoV-2 detection in tissues by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM) can help answer these questions, but a comprehensive evaluation of these applications is missing.METHODS: We assessed publications using IHC and EM for SARS-CoV-2 detection inautopsy tissues. We systematically evaluated commercially available antibodiesagainst the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in cultured cell lines and COVID-19 autopsytissues. In a multicentre study, we evaluated specificity, reproducibility, andinter-observer variability of SARS-CoV-2 IHC. We correlated RT-qPCR viral tissue loads with semiquantitative IHC scoring. We used qualitative and quantitative EM analyses to refine criteria for ultrastructural identification of SARS-CoV-2.FINDINGS: Publications show high variability in detection and interpretation ofSARS-CoV-2 abundance in autopsy tissues by IHC or EM. We show that IHC usingantibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid yields the highest sensitivity andspecificity. We found a positive correlation between presence of viral proteinsby IHC and RT-qPCR-determined SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (N= 35; r=-0.83, p-value <0.0001). For EM, we refined criteria for virus identification and providerecommendations for optimized sampling and analysis. 135 of 144 publicationsmisinterpret cellular structures as virus using EM or show only insufficientdata. We provide publicly accessible digitized EM sections as a reference and fortraining purposes. INTERPRETATION: Since detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human autopsytissues by IHC and EM is difficult and frequently incorrect, we propose criteria for a re-evaluation of available data and guidance for further investigations of direct organ effects by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Wastewater monitoring as a public health tool is well-established and theSARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has seen its widespread uptake. Given thesignificant potential of wastewater monitoring as a public health surveillanceand decision support tool, it is important to understand what measures arerequired to allow the long-term benefits of wastewater monitoring to be fullyrealized, including how to establish and/or maintain public support. Thepotential for positive SARS-CoV-2 detections to trigger enforced, community-wide public health interventions (e.g., lockdowns and other impacts on civilliberties) further emphasises the need to better understand the role of publicengagement in successful wastewater-based monitoring programs. This papersystematically reviews the processes of building and maintaining the sociallicense to operate wastewater monitoring. We specifically explore therelationship between different stakeholder communities and highlight theinformation and actions that are required to establish a social license tooperate and then prevent its loss. The paper adds to the literature on sociallicense to operate by extending its application to new domains and offers adynamic model of social license to help guide the agenda for researcher andpractitioner communities.

AB  - Coronavirus is a type of RNA-positive single-stranded virus with an envelope, andthe spines on its surface derived its official name. Seven human coronaviruses229E, OC43, SARS, NL63, HKU1, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 can cause both a mild cold and an epidemic of large-scale deaths and injuries. Although their clinicalmanifestations and many other pathogens that cause human colds are similar,studying the relationship between their evolutionary history and the receptorsthat infect the host can provide important insights into the natural history ofhuman epidemics in the past and future. In this review, we describe the basicvirology of these seven coronaviruses, their partial genome characteristics, and emphasize the function of receptors. We summarize the current understanding ofthese viruses and discuss the potential host of wild animals of thesecoronaviruses and the origin of zoonotic diseases.

AB  - The activities of community-based health actors are widely recognized as criticalto pandemic response; yet, there exists a lack of clarity concerning who isincluded in this ecosystem of actors and how these actors experience thecomplexity of delivering community-level care in the context of a public healthemergency. The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize the livedexperiences of community-based health actors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines; and (2) to identify opportunities for further supporting thesecritical actors in the health workforce. Virtual semi-structured interviews were conducted (January-February 2021) with 28 workers employed by a Philippines-basednon-governmental organization (NGO) to explore their lived experiences during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed thematically using a hybridinductive-deductive coding process, informed by Tronto's conceptualization of an ethic of care. Lived experiences among study participants were shaped bydiscourses of fear and care, and the interaction between these two affects.Participants reported everyday experiences of fear: NGO workers' fears ofcontracting and transmitting COVID-19 to others; perceived fear among communitymembers where they worked; and fears around COVID-19 testing, recognizing thepersonal and social implications (e.g. stigma) of a positive test. Amid fear,participants had everyday experiences of care: care was a powerful motivator tocontinue their work; they felt supported by a caring organization thatimplemented safety protocols and provided material supports to those inquarantine; and they engaged in self-care practices. These findings contribute tounderstanding the ecosystem of actors involved in community-based health care andengagement efforts and the challenges they encounter in their work, particularly in a pandemic context. We highlight implications for civil society organizations charged with protecting the mental and physical well-being of their workers anddescribe how these actions can contribute to local health systems strengthening.

AB  - Host to one billion people around the world, informal settlements are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 lockdown measures as they already lack basic services suchas water, toilets, and secure housing. Additionally, many residents work ininformal labor markets that have been affected by the lockdowns, resulting infurther reductions in access to resources, including clean water. This study usesa cross-sectional design (n = 532) to examine the vulnerabilities of householdsto employment and business disruptions, water access and hygiene practices duringthe COVID-19 lockdowns between April and June 2020 in three informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. We used survey questions from the Household Water InsecurityExperience Scale (HWISE) to investigate the relationship between employment andbusiness disruptions, water access, and hygiene practices (i.e., hand washing,body washing, clothes washing, and being able to use or drink clean water). Ofthe sampled households, 96% were forced to reduce work hours during thelockdowns, and these households had 92% lower odds of being able to afford water than households who did not experience a work hour reduction (OR = 0.08, p <.001). Household challenges in affording water were likely due to a combinationof reduced household income, increased water prices, and pre-existing poverty,and were ultimately associated with lower hygiene scores (Beta = 1.9, p < .001). Our results highlight a compounding tragedy of reduced water access in informalsettlements that were already facing water insecurities at a time when water is afundamental requirement for following hygiene guidelines to reduce disease burdenduring an ongoing pandemic. These outcomes emphasize the need for targetedinvestments in permanent water supply infrastructures and improved hygienebehaviors as a public health priority among households in informal settlements.

AB  - The resulting pandemic from the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), continues to exert a strain on worldwide health servicesdue to the incidence of hospitalization and mortality associated with infection. The aim of clinical services throughout the period of the pandemic and likelybeyond to endemic infections as the situation stabilizes is to enhance safetyaspects to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 while providing a high quality ofservice to all patients (COVID-19 positive and negative) while still upholdingexcellent medical standards. In order to achieve this, new strategies of clinicalservice operation are essential. Researchers have published peer-reviewedreference materials such as guidelines, experiences and advice to manage theresulting issues from the unpredictable challenges presented by the pandemic.There is a range of international guidance also from professional medicalorganizations, including best practice and advice in order to help imagingfacilities adjust their standard operating procedures and workflows in line with infection control principles. This work provides a broad review of the mainsources of advice and guidelines for radiology and nuclear medicine facilitiesduring the pandemic, and also of rapidly emerging advice and local/nationalexperiences as facilities begin to resume previously canceled non-urgent servicesas well as effects on imaging research.

AB  - Introduction: Due to the measures imposed by governments to reduce the spread of this new virus, the economic sector was one of the most affected during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Several labor sectors had to undergo a virtual adaptationprocess resulting in job instability and job loss. The objective of this studywas to revalidate an ultra-short scale for measuring perceived job security inLatin America. Methods: A revalidation study was done on a short scale thatmeasures worker's perceived security about losing or keeping their job in thenear future. Results: The four items remained on the revalidated scale, where allfour explained a single factor. The goodness-of-fit measures confirmed thesingle-factor model (chi: 7.06; df: 2; p = 0.29; mean square error: 0.015;goodness-of-fit index: 0.998; adjusted goodness-of-fit index: 0.991; comparative fit index: 0.999; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.997; normalized fit index: 0.998;incremental fit index: 0.999; and root mean square error of approximation:0.036). The scale's reliability was calculated using McDonald's omegacoefficient, obtaining an overall result of omega = 0.72. Conclusions: The scale was correctly revalidated in Latin America, and the four items were kept in asingle reliable factor.

TI  - Implementation and Impact of Choosing Wisely Recommendations in Oncology.
PG  - OP2200130
LID - 10.1200/OP.22.00130 [doi]
AB  - The Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign, launched in 2012, includes oncology-specificrecommendations to promote evidence-based care and deimplementation of low-value practices. However, it is unclear to what extent the campaign has promptedpractice change. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the uptakeof cancer-specific CW recommendations focusing on the period before thedeclaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used Grimshaw's deimplementationframework to thematically group the findings and extracted information onimplementation strategies, barriers, and facilitators from articles reporting on active implementation. In the 98 articles addressing 32 unique recommendations,most reported on passive changes in adherence pre-post publication of CWrecommendations. Use of active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer andreduction in staging imaging for early breast cancer were the most commonlyevaluated recommendations. Most articles assessing passive changes in adherencepre-post CW publication reported improvement. All articles evaluating activeimplementation (10 of 98) reported improved compliance (range: 3%-73%improvement). Most common implementation strategies included provider educationand/or stakeholder engagement. Preconceived views and reluctance to adopt newpractices were common barriers; common facilitators included the use oftechnology and provider education to increase provider buy-in. Given the limited uptake of oncology-specific CW recommendations thus far, more attention towardsupporting active implementation is needed. Effective adoption of CW likelyrequires a multipronged approach that includes building stakeholder buy-inthrough engagement and education, using technology-enabled forced functions tofacilitate change along with policy and reimbursement models that disincentivize low-value care. Professional societies have a role to play in supporting thisnext phase of CW.

TI  - Carbon Footprint of Alternative Grocery Shopping and Transportation Options from Retail Distribution Centers to Customer.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02050 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of e-commerce and automatedwarehouses, vehicles, and robots and has created new options for grocery supplychains. We report and compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for a 36-itemgrocery basket transported along 72 unique paths from a centralized warehouse to the customer, including impacts of micro-fulfillment centers, refrigeration,vehicle automation, and last-mile transportation. Our base case is in-storeshopping with last-mile transportation using an internal combustion engine (ICE) SUV (6.0 kg CO2e). The results indicate that emissions reductions could beachieved by e-commerce with micro-fulfillment centers (16-54%), customer vehicle electrification (18-42%), or grocery delivery (22-65%) compared to the base case.In-store shopping with an ICE pick-up truck has the highest emissions of allpaths investigated (6.9 kg CO2e) while delivery using a sidewalk automated robot has the least (1.0 kg CO2e). Shopping frequency is an important factor forhouseholds to consider, e.g. halving shopping frequency can reduce GHG emissions by 44%. Trip chaining also offers an opportunity to reduce emissions withapproximately 50% savings compared to the base case. Opportunities for grocersand households to reduce grocery supply chain carbon footprints are identifiedand discussed.

AB  - This study is conducted on people in Turkey who had at least one dose ofvaccination and it evaluates their differences in attitude in terms of healthliteracy, product judgment, the country of origin, intention to recommend andmotivation to boycott. The 393 vaccine consumers were selected through convenientsampling and the data was collected through online questionnaires. The data waslater analyzed by SPSS and AMOS. Normality, reliability tests and frequencyanalysis were conducted on the data. Afterward, a correlation was calculatedusing factor loadings to determine the relationship between the variables. Thelast was conducting the PATH analysis. Some consumers are prejudiced towardCOVID-19 vaccines due to perceived distrust, hesitation, and lack of productinformation. Determining the prejudices of consumers, underlying causes andmaking inferences will provide more useful information on COVID-19 vaccines tohealth institutions, vaccine manufacturers, consumers and other organizations.

AB  - BackgroundMechanically ventilated COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) patients often receive deeper sedation and analgesia to maintainrespiratory compliance and minimize staff exposure, which incurs greater risk of iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) and has been associated with worse patientoutcomes. Objective: To identify potential risk factors and differences inpatient outcomes associated with the development of IWS in COVID-19 ARDSpatients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of ventilated COVID-19 ARDS intensivecare unit (ICU) patients who received continuous intravenous (IV) analgesia andsedation for >/=5 days from March 2020-May 2021. Patients were classified as IWS and non-IWS based on receipt of scheduled oral sedative/analgesic regimens after cessation of IV therapy. Risk factors were assessed in univariate analyses andmultivariable modeling. Results: A total of 115 patients were included. The finalmultivariable model showed: (1) each additional day of IV opioid therapy wasassociated with an 8% increase in odds of IWS (95% CI, 1.02-1.14), (2) amongsedatives, receipt of lorazepam was associated with 3 times higher odds of IWS(95% CI 1.12-8.15), and (3) each 1-point increase in Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II was associated with a 4% reduction in odds of IWS (95% CI0.93-0.999). Conclusion: Prolonged and high dose exposures to IV opioids andbenzodiazepines should be limited when possible. Additional prospective studiesare needed to identify modifiable risk factors to prevent IWS.

TI  - Assessing suspension and infectivity times of virus-loaded aerosols involved inairborne transmission.
PG  - e2204593119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2204593119 [doi]
AB  - Airborne transmission occurs through droplet-mediated transport of virusesfollowing the expulsion of an aerosol by an infected host. Transmissionefficiency results from the interplay between virus survival in the dryingdroplet and droplet suspension time in the air, controlled by the couplingbetween water evaporation and droplet sedimentation. Furthermore, droplets aremade of a respiratory fluid and thus, display a complex composition consisting ofwater and nonvolatile solutes. Here, we quantify the impact of this complexcomposition on the different phenomena underlying transmission. Solutes lead to anonideal thermodynamic behavior, which sets an equilibrium droplet size that isindependent of relative humidity. In contrast, solutes do not significantlyhinder transport due to their low initial concentration. Realistic suspensiontimes are computed and increase with increasing relative humidity or decreasingtemperature. By uncoupling drying and suspended stages, we observe that envelopedviruses may remain infectious for hours in dried droplets. However, theirinfectivity decreases with increasing relative humidity or temperature afterdozens of minutes. Examining expelled droplet size distributions in the light of these results leads to distinguishing two aerosols. Most droplets measure between0 and 40 microm and compose an aerosol that remains suspended for hours. Itstransmission efficiency is controlled by infectivity, which decreases withincreasing humidity and temperature. Larger droplets form an aerosol that onlyremains suspended for minutes but corresponds to a much larger volume and thus,viral load. Its transmission efficiency is controlled by droplet suspension time,which decreases with increasing humidity and decreasing temperature.

PG  - e0272740
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272740 [doi]
AB  - Uninsured or underinsured individuals with cancer are likely to experiencefinancial hardship, including forgoing healthcare or non-healthcare needs such asfood, housing, or utilities. This study evaluates the association between health insurance coverage and financial hardship among cancer survivors during theCOVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional analysis used Patient Advocate Foundation(PAF) survey data from May to July 2020. Cancer survivors who previously receivedcase management or financial aid from PAF self-reported challenges paying forhealthcare and non-healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Associationsbetween insurance coverage and payment challenges were estimated using Poissonregression with robust standard errors, which allowed for estimation of adjusted relative risks (aRR). Of 1,437 respondents, 74% had annual household incomes<$48,000. Most respondents were enrolled in Medicare (48%), 22% inemployer-sponsored insurance, 13% in Medicaid, 6% in an Affordable Care Act (ACA)plan, and 3% were uninsured. Approximately 31% of respondents reported troublepaying for healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who wereuninsured (aRR 2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83-3.64), enrolled in an ACA plan (aRR 1.86, 95% CI 1.28-2.72), employer-sponsored insurance (aRR 1.70, 95% CI1.23-2.34), or Medicare (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09-2.03) had higher risk of troublepaying for healthcare compared to Medicaid enrollees. Challenges paying fornon-healthcare needs were reported by 57% of respondents, with 40% reportingtrouble paying for food, 31% housing, 28% transportation, and 20% internet. Inadjusted models, Medicare and employer-sponsored insurance enrollees were lesslikely to have difficulties paying for non-healthcare needs compared to Medicaid beneficiaries. Despite 97% of our cancer survivor sample being insured, 31% and57% reported trouble paying for healthcare and non-healthcare needs during theCOVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Greater attention to both medical andnon-medical financial burden is needed given the economic pressures of theCOVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hesitancy and incomplete vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) remains an obstacle to achieving herd immunity. Because of fear ofvaccine reactions, patients with medical and allergic co-morbidities expressheightened hesitancy. Limited information is available to guide these patients.We sought to identify factors associated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccineshesitancy and reactogenicity. METHODS: We surveyed employees of a multi-sitehealth system in central Pennsylvania who were offered the COVID-19 vaccine (N = 18,740) inquiring about their experience with the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTechmRNA-based vaccines. The survey was administered online using the REDCapplatform. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine whether aparticular factor(s) (e.g., demographics, selected co-morbid allergic and medicalconditions, vaccine brand, and prior COVID-19) were associated with vaccinereactogenicity including the occurrence and severity of local and systemicreactions. We also explored factors and reasons associated with vaccinehesitancy. RESULTS: Of the 5709 who completed the survey (response rate, 30.4%), 369 (6.5%) did not receive the vaccine. Black race and allergy to other vaccines were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Reaction intensity following the firstvaccine dose and allergic co-morbidities were associated with incompletevaccination. Older individuals (>60 years) experienced less reactogenicity.Females had higher odds of local and systemic reactions and reported more severe reactions. Asians reported more severe reactions. As compared to Pfizer-BioNTech,the Moderna vaccine was associated with higher odds of vaccine reactions ofhigher severity. Prior COVID-19 resulted in more severe reactions following thefirst dose, but less severe reactions following the second dose. CONCLUSIONS:Targeted campaigns to enhance vaccination acceptance should focus on Blackindividuals, females, and those with allergic co-morbidities. Prior COVID-19caused more severe reactions after the first but not the second vaccine dose.Moderna vaccine caused more vaccine reactions. Lessons learned from the earlyrollout of COVID-19 vaccine may serve to inform future novel vaccine experiences.

PG  - e0272609
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a substantial decline in in-person care in inpatientand outpatient settings during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Avoidance of neededin-person care may contribute to an avoidable decline in patient health and anincrease in mortality. While several systems and behavioral theories have beenput forward to explain the decline, there is a lack of studies informed bypatients' own experiences. The current study applied a socio-ecological modelencompassing patient, environmental, and institutional-related variables toexamine patient-reported factors associated with avoidance of in-person care.METHODS: Between October and December 2020, a total of 3840 persons responded to a nationwide online questionnaire that was administered using ResearchMatch andFacebook. Self-reported avoidance of in-person care among those who needed it wasthe main outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identifyfactors associated with avoidance of needed care. FINDINGS: Out of a total of3372 respondents who reported that they needed in-person care during the earlyphase of the pandemic, 257 (7.6%) avoided it. Patient-related variablesassociated with avoiding needed care included younger age (odds ratio (OR), 1.46,95% CI 1.11 to 1.94, p<0.01; <45 y/o vs 45+), inability to afford care (OR =1.65, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.34, p<0.01), and greater COVID-related stress (OR = 1.36, CI 1.01 to 1.83, p<0.05). More frequent discussions about COVID with family andfriends was the only significant environment-related avoidance of care variable(OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.01-1.91, p < .05). Institution-related care avoidancevariables included a negative patient healthcare experience rating (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.42, p<0.001), poor awareness of the institution's safety protocol(OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.51, p<0.01), and low ratings of the institution'seffectiveness in communicating their safety protocol (OR = 3.45, 95% CI 1.94 to6.12, p<0.001). The final model predicted 11.9% of the variance in careavoidance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that care avoidance of in-personcare during the initial phase of the pandemic was influenced by a patient'sdemographics as well as environmental and healthcare institutional factors.Patients' previous experiences and their awareness of healthcare systems' safety protocols are important factors in care avoidance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With fragile health care systems, sub-Saharan Africa countries likeEthiopia are facing a complex epidemic, and become difficult to control the noblecoronavirus. The use of COVID-19 preventive measures is strongly recommended.This study aimed to assess the adherence of COVID-19 mitigation measures andassociated factors among health care workers. METHODS: A facility-basedcross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers at referralhospitals in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia from May 15 to June 10; 2021. It was a web-based study using an online questionnaire. STATA 14.2 was used fordata analysis. Variables with a p-value<0.05 at 95% confidence level inmultivariable analysis were declared as statistically significant using binarylogistic regression. RESULT: Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures was 50.24%in the current study. The odd of adherence of participants with a monthly income of >/=12801birr was 15% whereas the odds of adherence of participants whohesitate to take the COVID 19 vaccine were 10% as compared to those who don'thesitate. Participants who had undergone COVID-19 tests adhered 6.64 times morethan their counterparts. Those who believe adequate measurements are taken by thegovernment adhered 4.6 times more than those who believe not adequate.Participants who believe as no risk of severe disease adhered 16% compared tothose with fear of severe disease. Presence of households aged >60years adheredabout 7.9 times more than with no households aged>60. Participants suspected ofCOVID-19 diagnosis adhered 5.7 times more than those not suspected. CONCLUSION:In this study, a significant proportion of healthcare workers did not adhere toCOVID-19 mitigation measures. Hence, giving special attention to healthcareworkers with a monthly income of >/=12801 birr, being hesitant towards COVID-19vaccine, being aged 26-30, and perceiving no risk of developing a severeinfection is crucial to reduce non-adherence.

PG  - e0272569
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272569 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Emergency Department (ED) services play a fundamental role inmanaging the accesses of potential Sars-Cov-2 cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the SARS COV-2 pandemic on pediatric accesses in EmergencyDepartment of Lazio Region. METHODS: The population includes all pediatricaccesses (0-17 years) in the ED of Lazio Region during 2019 and 2020. Accesseswere characterized by age, week and calendar period. Four periods were defined:pre-lockdown, lockdown, post-lockdown and the second wave. The trend of EDaccesses (total or for specific cause) in 2020 (by period and week) were comparedto them occurred in 2019. ED visits have been described by absolute frequency andpercentage variation. Percentage variation of adult was also reported to compare the trend in adult and young population. The Chi-square test was used to compare characteristics of admissions in 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: There is a largedecrease of pediatric accesses in 2020 compared to 2019 (-47%), especially foryounger age-classes (1-2 years: -52.5% and 3-5 years: -50.5%). Pediatric visitsto ED in 2020 decreased following the same trend of adults, but more drastically (-47% vs -30%). ED accesses for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia trend show differentcharacteristics between children and adults: in adults there is an increase in2020, especially during the 2nd wave period (+321%), in children there is adecrease starting from the lockdown period to the achievement of the lowest levelin December 2020 (-98%). CONCLUSIONS: This descriptive study has identified adecrease of total pediatric accesses in ED in 2020 compared to 2019 and adifferent trend of accesses by adult and young population especially by cause.The monitoring of paediatric accesses could be a useful tool to analyse the trendof COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and to reprogramming of the healthcare offeraccording to criteria of clinical and organizational appropriateness.

TI  - The impact of crop specialization on nutritional intake: Evidence from farmhouseholds in China.
PG  - e0272347
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272347 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the wake of the severe impact of COVID-19 on the food security of the vulnerable groups in rural areas, the issue of how to achieve the SustainableDevelopment Goals 2 aims to "Zero Hunger" (SDG 2) and ensure the food safety offarmers has drawn unprecedented attention. Nutritional intake is generally usedas an important indicator to reflect family food security. Under the backgroundthat Chinese farmers have gradually changed from the traditional diversifiedproduction mode to the specialized production of crops, the main purpose of this article is to explore what are the impact of crop specialization on farmers'nutritional intake? Could the specialization of crop production be taken as animportant measure to ensure the food safety of farmers and achieve the SDG 2?METHODS: Based on the micro-survey data from 866 farmer households in China, thispaper using Seemingly Unrelated Regressions model, Group Regression model andMediating Effect model to analyze the average and heterogeneous effects of cropspecialization on the nutritional intake of farmers, as well as the mediatingeffect of income. In addition, robustness test and endogenous treatment wereperformed by using alternative explanatory variables and IV-2SLS method was used to estimate the results. RESULTS: After correcting for endogenous bias, cropspecialization had a significant negative impact on energy intake and fat intake of farmers at the statistical level of 5% and 1% respectively, especially forfarmers in mountainous areas. Household income played a mediating effect on theeffect of crop specialization on farmers' energy and fat intake, and theproportion of the masking effect was 8.43% and 8.96% respectively. In addition,household financial capital and social capital have a significant positive impacton farmers' nutritional intake. CONCLUSIONS: Crop specialization cannot guaranteethe food safety of farmers in terms of nutritional intake. However, when thedevelopment trend of crop specialization is irreversible, more attention shouldbe paid to improving the level of various livelihood capital of farmers,especially those in mountainous areas, and to continuously increasing theirincome to ease and ultimately eliminate the negative impact of cropspecialization on farmers' nutritional intake, which finally make everyonerealize the SDG 2.

TI  - Mobile app to perform anonymized longitudinal studies in the context of COVID-19 adverse drug reaction monitoring, leveraging the citizenship engagement.
LID - 10.2196/38701 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last few years, increasingly studies focused on thedevelopment of mobile apps as complementary tools to existing pharmacovigilancetraditional surveillance systems for improving and facilitating adverse drugreactions reporting. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the potentiality of anew mobile app (vaxEffect@UniMiB) to perform longitudinal studies whilepreserving the anonymity of the respondents. We applied it to monitor the adversedrug reactions during COVID-19 vaccination campaign in a sample of Italianpopulation. METHODS: We administered vaxEffect@UniMiB to a convenience sample of academic subjects vaccinated at Milano-Bicocca University hub for COVID-19 duringthe Italian national vaccination campaign. vaxEffect@UniMiB was developed forboth Android and iOS devices. The mobile app asks users to send their medicalhistory and, upon every vaccine administration, their vaccination data and theadverse reactions that occurred within seven days after the vaccination, allowingthe follow of reactions dynamic for each respondent. The app sends data over the web to an application server. The web server, along with receiving all user data,saves them in a SQL database server, and reminds patients to submit vaccine andadverse reactions' data by push notifications sent to the mobile app throughFirebase Cloud Messaging. On initial startup of the app, a unique user identifierwas generated for each respondent, so that its anonymity is completely ensured,while enabling longitudinal studies. RESULTS: A total of 3712 people have beenvaccinated during the first vaccination wave. A total of 2733 respondents betweenthe ages of 19 and 80, coming from the University of Milano-Bicocca and thePolitecnico of Milan, participated in the survey. Overall, we collected theinformation about vaccination and adverse reactions to the first vaccine dose for2226 subjects (60.0% of vaccinated), to the second dose for 1610 subjects(43.3%), and, in a non-sponsored fashion, to the third dose for 169 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: vaxEffect@UniMiB revealed to be the first attempt in performinglongitudinal studies to monitor the same subject over time in terms of thereported ADRs after each vaccine administration, while guaranteeing at the sametime complete anonymity of the subjects. A series of aspects contributed to apositive involvement from people in using this application to report their ADRsto vaccination: ease of use, availability from multiple platforms, anonymity ofall the survey participants and protection of the submitted data and thehealthcare workers' support.

AB  - PURPOSE: Beliefs that the risks from a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the risks fromgetting COVID-19 and concerns that the vaccine development process was rushed andlacking rigor have been identified as important drivers of hesitancy and refusal to get a COVID-19 vaccine. We tested whether messages designed to address thesebeliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine. METHOD: We conducted an online survey fielded between March 8-23, 2021 with US Veteran (n= 688) and non-Veteran (n = 387) respondents. In a between-subjects experiment,respondents were randomly assigned to a control group (with no message) or toread one of two intervention messages: 1. a fact-box styled message comparing therisks of getting COVID-19 compared to the vaccine, and 2. a timeline styledmessage describing the development process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.RESULTS: Most respondents (60%) wanted a COVID-19 vaccine. However, 17% expressedhesitancy and 23% did not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The fact-box styledmessage and the timeline message did not significantly improve vaccinationintentions, F(2,358) = 0.86, p = .425, [Formula: see text] = .005, or reduce the time respondents wanted to wait before getting vaccinated, F(2,306) = 0.79, p =.453, [Formula: see text] = .005, compared to no messages. DISCUSSION: In thisexperimental study, we did not find that providing messages about vaccine risksand the development process had an impact on respondents' vaccine intentions.Further research is needed to identify how to effectively address concerns about the risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines and the development process and tounderstand additional factors that influence vaccine intentions.

TI  - Answering hospital caregivers' questions at any time: proof of concept of anartificial intelligence-based chatbot in a French hospital.
LID - 10.2196/39102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Access to accurate information in health is a key point forcaregivers to avoid medication errors, especially with the reorganization ofstaff and drugs circuits during health crises such as COVID 19. It is thereforethe role of the hospital pharmacy to answer caregivers' questions. Some mayrequire the expertise of a pharmacist, some should be answered by pharmacytechnicians, but others are simple and redundant, and automated responses may be given. OBJECTIVE: We aimed at developing and implementing a chatbot to answerquestions from hospital caregivers, 24 hours a day, about drugs and pharmacyorganization, and evaluated this tool. METHODS: The ADDIE model: Analysis,Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation, was used by a multi-professionalteam composed of 3 hospital pharmacists, 2 members of the Innovation andTransformation Department, and the Information Technology (IT) service provider. Based on an analysis of the caregivers' needs about drugs and pharmacyorganization, we designed and developed a chatbot. The tool was then evaluatedbefore the implementation into the hospital intranet. Its relevance andconversations with testers were monitored via the IT provider's back office.RESULTS: Needs analysis with 5 hospital pharmacists and 33 caregivers from 5health services allowed us to identify 7 themes about drugs and pharmacyorganization (such as opening hours and specific prescriptions). After a year of chatbot design and development, the test version obtained good evaluation scores:its speed was rated 8.2/10, usability 8.1/10, and appearance 7.5/10. Testers weregenerally satisfied (70%) and were hoping for the content to be enhanced.CONCLUSIONS: The chatbot seems to be a relevant tool for hospital caregivers,helping them to get reliable and verified information they need on drugs andpharmacy organization. In the context of significant mobility of nursing staffduring the health crisis due to COVID-19, the chatbot could be a suitable toolfor transmitting relevant information related to drugs circuits or specificprocedures. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a tool has beendesigned for caregivers. Its development further continued by means of testsconducted with other users such as pharmacy technicians, and via the integration of additional data, before the implementation on the two hospital sites.CLINICALTRIAL:

TI  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on medical teaching in obstetrics andgynecology-A nationwide expert survey among teaching coordinators at Germanuniversity hospitals.
PG  - e0269562
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269562 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed severe challenges on medical educationat German university hospitals. In this first German nationwide expert survey, weaddressed the responsible university teaching coordinators in obstetrics andgynecology departments and investigated their experiences during the pandemic as well as their opinions on future developments, especially with regard to thebroader implementation of e-learning in the standard curriculum. METHODS: Thequestionnaire included 42 items and was disseminated among teaching coordinators at all 41 departments of obstetrics and gynecology at German university hospitalsvia an email that included a weblink to the online survey provider. Responseswere collected between 19 April and 7 June 2021. RESULTS: In total, 30 responses were collected from 41 departments across Germany and their respective teachingcoordinators in obstetrics and gynecology. The general opinion of the medicalteaching provided during the pandemic was positive, whereas the teaching quality in practical skills was considered inferior and not equivalent to the standardface-to-face curriculum. Lectures and seminars had to be substituted byremote-learning alternatives, while clinical clerkships were reduced in lengthand provided less patient contact. Students in their final year experienced only a few differences in the clinical and teaching routine. Teaching coordinators in obstetrics and gynecology stated that they intend to incorporate more e-learning into the curriculum in the future. CONCLUSION: The medical educators' viewspresented here may help to complement the already-thoroughly investigatedexperiences of students under the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical educators in obstetrics and gynecology at German university hospitals havesuccessfully established online and hybrid teaching alternatives to theirstandard face-to-face courses. Building on recent experiences, digitalizationcould help to improve future medical education.

AB  - RATIONALE: Inhaled antimicrobials enable high local concentrations where neededand, compared to orally administration, greatly reduce the potential for systemicside effects. In SARS-CoV-2 infections, hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ)administered as dry powder via inhalation could be safer than oral HCQ allowinghigher and therefore more effective pulmonary concentrations without doselimiting toxic effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess the local tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters of HCQ inhalations in single ascending doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg using the Cyclops dry powder inhaler. METHODS: Twelve healthyvolunteers were included in the study. Local tolerability and safety wereassessed by pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram and recording adverseevents. To estimate systemic exposure, serum samples were collected before and0.5, 2 and 3.5 h after inhalation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Dry powder HCQinhalations were well tolerated by the participants, except for transient bitter taste in all participants and minor coughing irritation. There was no significantchange in QTc-interval or drop in FEV1 post inhalation. The serum HCQconcentration remained below 10 mug/L in all samples. CONCLUSION: Single doses ofinhaled dry powder HCQ up to 20 mg are safe and well tolerated. Our data support that further studies with inhaled HCQ dry powder to evaluate pulmonarypharmacokinetics and efficacy are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 international travel restrictions has to date,not been fully explored, and with the ongoing threat that new variants couldpotentially restrict movement further, it is important to consider the impactsthat travel restrictions have on community members. This study aimed to evaluate the psychological and financial impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions on thoseseparated from their partners or immediate families, as well as temporary visaholders who were unable to migrate. METHODS: Between 4 November 2021 to 1December 2021, we executed a cross-sectional online survey targeting threespecific groups; (1) those stranded from their partners; (2) those stranded from immediate families; and (3) temporary visa holders unable to migrate or crossinternational borders. We collected data on respondents' demographic profile; thenature of COVID-19-related travel impacts; depression, anxiety, and stress levels(using the validated DASS-21); and finally, data on respondents financial,employment and accommodation situation. RESULTS: 1363 respondents locatedglobally completed the survey. 71.2% reported financial stress, 76.8% ([Formula: see text], SD = 5.94) reported moderate-to-extremely severe depression, 51.6%([Formula: see text], SD = 5.49) moderate-to-extremely severe anxiety, and 62.6% ([Formula: see text], SD = 5.55) moderate-to-extremely severe stress levels.Statistically significant factors associated with moderate-to-extremely severedepression, anxiety, and stress included being female, chronic illness, andexperiencing financial stress. Employment during COVID-19 -specifically essentialservices workers or unemployed-was associated with higher levels of anxiety andstress, with only essential workers being a predictor of higher stress severity. Factors that provided psychological protection included being older and havingchildren. CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to explore the impactCOVID-19-related international travel restrictions have had on the financialstatus and psychological health of affected individuals. It highlights thesignificant human cost associated with the restrictions and identifiespsychologically vulnerable populations. These results will help the design oftargeted health and social policy responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumothorax has been increasingly observed among patients withcoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, specifically in those patients whodevelop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this study, we sought todetermine the incidence and potential risk factors of pneumothorax in critically ill adults with COVID-19. METHOD: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to one of theadult intensive care units of a tertiary, academic teaching hospital from May2020 through May 2021. RESULTS: Among 334 COVID-19 cases requiring ICU admission,the incidence of pneumothorax was 10% (33 patients). Patients who experiencedpneumothorax more frequently required vasopressor support (28/33 [84%] vs.191/301 [63%] P = 0.04), were more likely to be proned (25/33 [75%] vs. 111/301[36%], P<0.001), and the presence of pneumothorax was associated with prolongedduration of mechanical ventilation; 21 (1-97) versus 7 (1-79) days, p<0.001 aswell as prolonged hospital length of stay (29 [9-133] vs. 15 [1-90] days,P<0.001), but mortality was not significantly different between groups.Importantly, when we performed a Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) model ofmultivariate parameters, we found that administration of tocilizumabsignificantly increased the risk of developing pneumothorax (HR = 10.7; CI[3.6-32], P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Among 334 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the incidence of pneumothorax was 10%. Presence of pneumothorax was associatedwith prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay.Strikingly, receipt of tocilizumab was associated with an increased risk ofdeveloping pneumothorax.

AB  - PURPOSE: Available but insufficient evidence shows that changes may occur in the immune system following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present studyaimed at evaluating immunological changes in patients with severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia compared with thecontrol group. METHOD: The present study was performed on 95 patients withCOVID-19 (32 severe and 63 moderate cases) and 22 healthy controls. Relationship between immune cells, disease severity and lung involvement was assessed. Binary logistic regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in CD20+ cell counts of thepatients. To differentiate patients from healthy individuals, the cutoff pointfor the CD4+ cell count was 688 /muL, sensitivity 0.96, and specificity 0.84. An increase in CD4+ cells reduces the odds of severe disease (odds ratio = 0.82, P =0.047) and death (odds ratio = 0.74, P = 0.029). CD4+ cells play a pivotal rolein the severity of lung involvement (P = 0.03). In addition to CD4+ cells, Fcgamma receptor III (FcgammaRIII) (CD16) also played a significant prognosis (oddsratio = 0.55, P = 0.047). In severe cases, C-reactive protein, Blood ureanitrogen, and Creatine phosphokinase levels, as well as neutrophil counts, weresignificantly higher than those of moderate ones whereas lymphocyte count insevere cases was lower than that of moderate ones. CONCLUSION: The number oftotal T-cells and B-cells in patients with COVID-19 was lower than that ofcontrols; however, their NK cells increased. FcgammaRIII and CD4+ cells are ofgreat importance due to their association with COVID-19 prognosis.

AB  - With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of vaccine development,distribution, and uptake has come to the forefront of the public eye. Effectivelyfielding vaccines during an emergency-whether that emergency is a result of aninfectious disease or not-requires an understanding of usual vaccine-relatedprocesses; the impact of outbreak, complex emergencies, mass gatherings, andother events on patients, communities, and health systems; and ways in whichdiverse resources can be applied to successfully achieve needed vaccine uptake.In this review, both the emergency setting and briefly vaccine product design arediscussed in these contexts in order to provide a concise source of generalknowledge from experts in fielding vaccines that can aid in future vaccineventures and increase general awareness of the process and barriers in varioussettings.

PG  - 31-35
AB  - Despite its classification as an atypical pneumonia, COVID-19 is a disease thatis capable of inflicting damage beyond the respiratory system. The wide range of musculoskeletal complications secondary to acute COVID-19 are a significantsource of morbidity in hospitalized patients. We present the case of a23-year-old woman with severe COVID-19 who required intubation and had aprolonged hospital course that was complicated by partial-thickness necrosis ofher fingers and heterotopic ossification of the distal thigh. We review currenttreatments for these orthopedic conditions in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infectionas well as highlight areas for future research. Additionally, we discuss thesubacute musculoskeletal complications of COVID-19, which are among the mostcommon long-term manifestations of the disease and are increasingly important fora growing number of COVID-19 survivors.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a post-infectious neurocognitive syndromecharacterized by fatigue and deficits in attention, memory, and executivefunction. As screening cognitive testing generally remains normal, thepathophysiologic basis of these symptoms remains controversial and there is nostandardized treatment paradigm. We present a clinical case demonstrative oftypical neurocognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting medical andsocial factors that may have contributed to the severity of symptoms. We discuss the pathophysiologic evidence for cognitive "brain fog" following COVID-19infection as well as lifestyle changes and rehabilitation strategies that mayimprove recovery. As the benefits of pharmacologic therapy remain unproven, weclose with a brief discussion of medication options that might be appropriatetargets for future clinical trials in the context of rehabilitative treatment.

PG  - 16-22
AB  - Survivors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may experience persistentsymptoms, abnormal diagnostic test findings, incident disease in specific organsystems, or progression of existing disease. Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is defined by persistent, recurrent, or new symptoms, findings, or diagnosesbeyond four weeks after the initial infection. PACS has been characterized as amulti-organ syndrome, often with cardiopulmonary symptoms that include fatigue,dyspnea, chest pain, and palpitations. Cardiovascular pathologies in PACS includenew-onset arrhythmia, myocarditis, unmasked coronary artery disease, anddiastolic dysfunction as well as abnormal findings on electrocardiogram, troponintesting, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. In this review, we discuss thecardiovascular symptoms, pathophysiology, clinical investigation, and management strategies for cardiopulmonary symptoms of PACS. We offer a treatment algorithmfor primary care clinicians encountering patients with cardiopulmonary PACS anddiscuss ongoing research on this topic.

TI  - A Review of Respiratory Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) and the Potential Benefits of Pulmonary Rehabilitation.
PG  - 11-15
AB  - With the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continuing into its third year, the number ofpatients who survive acute COVID-19 infection but go on to develop long-termsymptoms is increasing daily. Those individuals who experience one or more of avariety of persistent symptoms post-COVID-19 are now diagnosed with the syndrome called post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), often colloquially called "LongCOVID." This article discusses relevant research and current hypotheses regardingthe pathophysiology and management of respiratory symptoms of PASC, in order toprovide primary care physicians with context for management of this heterogeneouspopulation. We focus on the growing body of research that supports the use ofpulmonary rehabilitation for patients with PASC to improve symptoms and qualityof life.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anti-COVID-19 vaccines have proved to be effective and welltolerated. Great attention is now being paid to the characterisation of possible adverse events associated to their administration. We report a case series ofsuspected rheumatic diseases (RDs) following anti-COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: We included patients evaluated at first-aid rheumatologic consultancy and atrheumatologic outpatient and inpatient clinic at Padova University Hospitalbetween May and September 2021 presenting with a RD within 30 days after ananti-COVID-19 vaccine dose. Our selection was in accordance with the World HealthOrganisation guidelines for adverse event following immunisation (AEFI)surveillance. Patients were regularly re-evaluated by telemedicine orface-to-face visit. RESULTS: We identified 30 cases of RD following vaccination: 24 (80.0%) new onsets and 6 (20.0%) flares. Most of patients (76.6%) received theBNT162b2 vaccine. The mean time to RD onset/flare was 12+/-9 days. The mostcommon manifestations were inflammatory arthritis (40.0%), rheumatic polymyalgia (33.3%) and adult-onset Still's disease (13.3%). At the last FU visit (9.6+/-2.2 months), 83.3% of patients showed complete response to first- or second-linetherapy, 13.3% a partial response and one patient (3.3%) was still experiencingan active disease. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the amount of vaccine dosesadministered during the evaluation period we overall detected a limited number ofcases. We noted a clear prevalence of autoinflammatory conditions andseronegative manifestations. The great majority of patients had mild features andshowed a good response to therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine scares undermine longstanding global health achievements.Remarkably little data has documented the lived experiences of policymakersworking amidst vaccine scares and navigating their fallout. As a result, chances and challenges of large-scale national recuperation efforts are poorlyunderstood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the perspectives ofpolicymakers involved in ongoing efforts to boost vaccine confidence in thePhilippines following a 2017 Dengvaxia scare and the current COVID-19 pandemic.METHODS: Between August and November 2020, we conducted 19 semi-structurednarrative interviews with purposively selected policymakers from governmentalagencies and non-governmental organizations in the Philippines. Interviews wereconducted online, transcribed, and analyzed following the tenets of reflexivethematic analysis. RESULTS: We present results as an emerging model that draws ona chronology conveyed by policymakers in their own words. The Dengvaxia scareproved 'a decisive wedge' that splintered Filipino society and pittedgovernmental agencies against one another. The scare stoked distorted vaccinationnarratives, which were 'accelerated rapidly' via social media, and ignitedfeelings of uncertainty among policymakers of how to convey clear, accuratehealth messaging and how to prevent drops in care-seeking more broadly.CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to regain trust placed exceptional burdens on analready-strained health system. Respondent-driven recommendations on how toreinforce vaccine confidence and improve vaccination rollout include: developing clear vaccine messages, fostering healthcare providers' and policymakers'communication skills, and rebuilding trust within, toward and across governmentalagencies. Further research on how to build enabling environments and rebuildtrust in and across institutions remains paramount.

AB  - Objective: Covid-19 has resulted in changes to college students' daily lives due to recommendations to socially distance. Social distance is likely to affectyouths' peer relationships at a time when these relationships remain importantfor development. Participants and Methods: The current study utilized survey datato examine perceived changes in peer relationships and the association withbehavioral health among 275 college students (Mage = 18.69, SD =.72) during thefall/spring of 2020-2021. Results: Quantitative results indicated thatparticipants reported significant perceived decreases in peer support but did notreport significantly worse quality of closest friendships. Qualitative responses from an open-ended survey question supported these quantitative resultssuggesting that although many participants perceived decreases in quality ofrelationships, there was also the perception that friendships became closer.Participants who perceived decreased peer relationship support and quality weremore likely to report depressive symptoms and loneliness when compared toparticipants who perceived no changes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate change in health behaviors and anxiety one year afterthe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: University students (n = 525)and faculty/staff (n = 136) surveyed in February-April 2021. METHODS:Cross-sectional survey on health behaviors and anxiety before and during thepandemic. Comparison by time and between groups using paired t-tests andchi-square tests. RESULTS: Diet quality of students did not differ comparingbefore to during the pandemic while diet quality improved among faculty/staff (p = 0.001). Physical activity decreased among students (p < 0.0001). Sedentary timeand prevalence of symptomatic anxiety increased among both students andfaculty/staff (all p < 0.05). Unhealthy changes in lifestyle and anxiety weremore pronounced among those who reported a less healthy diet or weight gainduring the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic onphysical activity, sedentary time, and anxiety have persisted approximately oneyear after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in a university population.

AB  - Objective: To compare physical activity (PA), sitting time, and substance usepre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 pandemic among US college students.Participants: 484 students from a large Western university (20.6 +/- 1.4 years,80.0% female) were recruited. Methods: Self-reported online surveys werecompleted in June-August 2020. T-tests and non-parametric analyses were conductedfor continuous and ordinal variables respectively. Results: Vigorous PA, moderatePA, and light PA decreased significantly by 32%, 27%, and 21% and sitting timeincreased significantly by 49% from pre-COVID-19 to during COVID-19 pandemic.Wine consumption was less during COVID-19 than pre-COVID-19 among female,non-first-generation, and White students. Sleep aids use was more frequent duringCOVID-19 than pre-COVID-19 pandemic among non-first-generation and Whitestudents. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic may influence college students' healthbehaviors including physical activity patterns, sitting time, and substance use. Effective health promotion and coping strategies should be widely available tocollege students during times of change and uncertainty.

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/17483107.2022.2107718 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite increased usage of telemedicine to deliver treatment during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the efficacy of telerehabilitation for spine pain is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect oftelerehabilitation on pain and disability in patients with spine pain treatedduring the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the results to in-clinic rehabilitation.MATERIALS & METHODS: In this propensity score-matched analysis, 428 patients withspine pain who underwent telerehabilitation during the 6 months of COVID-19pandemic lockdown and 428 patients who underwent in-clinic multimodalrehabilitation treatment during the 6-month period prior to lockdown werecompared. Propensity score matching was done based on gender, age, pre-treatment pain, and disability. Post-treatment numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Oswestryor Neck disability index (ODI or NDI), and minimal clinical important difference (MCID) achieved for NPRS and ODI/NDI scores were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: Post-treatment, the mean NPRS (mean difference - 1, p < 0.0001) andODI/NDI (mean difference - 5.8, p < 0.0001) scores, were significantly lower inthe telerehabilitation group when compared to control group. Similarly, thepercentage of patients who achieved MCID of >/= 2 for NPRS (mean difference - 6%,p = 0.0007) and MCID of >/= 10 for ODI/NDI (mean difference - 7.5%, p = 0.005)scores were significantly higher in the telerehabilitation group. CONCLUSIONS:Telerehabilitation achieved significant reduction in pain and disability amongpatients with spine pain, better than in-clinic rehabilitation. These encouragingresults during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate the need to further explore andtest the efficacy and wider application of telerehabilitation for treating spine pain.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTelerehabilitation can help achievesignificant reduction in pain and disability among patients with spine pain.Theseencouraging results indicate the need to further explore a wider application oftelerehabilitation for treating patients with spine pain during non-pandemictimes.

LID - 10.1080/10408363.2022.2102578 [doi]
AB  - While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) begins as a respiratory infection, itprogresses as a systemic disease involving multiorgan microthromboses thatunderly the pathology. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via attachment to theangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed in amultitude of tissues, including the lung (alveolar cells), heart, intestine,kidney, testis, gallbladder, vasculature (endothelial cells), and immune cells.Interference in ACE2 signaling could drive the aforementioned systemicpathologies, such as endothelial dysfunction, microthromboses, and systemicinflammation, that are typically seen in patients with severe COVID-19. ACE2 is acomponent of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is intimately associated withthe plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). As many papers are published on therole of ACE and ACE2 in COVID-19, we will review the role of bradykinin, and morebroadly the KSS, in SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, we willdiscuss the possible therapeutic interventions that are approved and indevelopment for the following targets: coagulation factor XII (FXII), tissuekallikrein (KLK1), plasma kallikrein (KLKB1), bradykinin (BK), plasminogenactivator inhibitor (PAI-1), bradykinin B1 receptor (BKB1R), bradykinin B2receptor (BKB2R), ACE, furin, and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Understanding thesetargets may prove of value in the treatment of COVID-19 as well as in othervirus-induced coagulopathies in the future.

TI  - Cancer Survivors' Perspectives of Virtual Yoga for Chronic Chemotherapy-InducedPeripheral Neuropathy Pain During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000937 [doi]
AB  - With the rise in telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic, further research isneeded to determine how to optimize virtual delivery of existing integrativeoncology interventions for cancer treatment-related symptoms. The purpose of thisqualitative analysis was to explore cancer survivors' perspectives of theacceptability and satisfaction of an 8-week, virtual yoga intervention for cancersurvivors with chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain. Fourteen participants with chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain whocompleted the virtual yoga intervention were interviewed using a semistructuredinterview guide. Themes were derived from the data using inductive contentanalysis methods. Main findings from the interviews included the following: (1)participants were willing to try new nonpharmacological treatments forchemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy due to the high symptom burden andprior lack of success with medications; (2) participants highly rated theflexibility offered by the virtual format, but desired the social supportpotentially offered by practicing in-person yoga; and (3) the impact of virtualyoga on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy severity was unclear. Therewere several barriers to participants' use of virtual yoga for chronicchemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain (eg, technology, lack ofspace/equipment). The results may be used to improve the design and delivery offuture trials testing virtual yoga for chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheralneuropathy pain.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this research was to uncover narratives around food accessand consumption among Black women who attend HBCUs before and during the COVID-19pandemic. Participants: Black women, ages 18-25. Methods: Focus groups were used to understand how participants defined healthy foods as well as barriers andfacilitators of consumption. During the pandemic follow-up focus groups uncoveredhow COVID-19 impacted their access and consumption patterns. Results: Findingsrevealed that HCBU women faced similar and distinct concerns around food accessprior to and during the pandemic. Students were limited by price, budgets,proximity to healthy foods, kitchen access, and cooking tools. However, proximityor transportation both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic encouragedstudents to access healthy foods. Conclusion: For students who are already at asocietal disadvantage and attend a university located in a food desert, access tonutritious foods can be an exacerbated plight.

TI  - Exploring the trajectory curve of long-term musculoskeletal post-COVID painsymptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors: a multicenter study.
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002718 [doi]
AB  - This multicenter cohort study investigated the prevalence of musculoskeletalpost-COVID pain during the first year after the infection with mosaic plots andan exponential bar plot model and its associated risk factors. Patientshospitalized because of COVID-19 in 5 hospitals of Madrid (Spain) were scheduled for a telephone interview at 2 follow-up periods after hospitalization forcollecting data about musculoskeletal post-COVID pain. Hospitalization andclinical data were collected from hospital medical records. From 2000 patientsinitially recruited, 1593 (44.6% women, age: 61 +/- 15 years) were assessed at T0(hospital admission), T1 (mean: 8.0 +/- 1.5 months after discharge), and T2(mean: 13.2 +/- 1.5 months after discharge). The prevalence of musculoskeletalpain (myalgia) was 30.3% (n = 483) at T0, increased to 43.4% (n = 692) at T1, anddecreased to 37.8% (n = 603) at T2. The trajectory curve revealed a decreasingprevalence trend of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain the following years afterhospitalization. According to the presence of pre-existing pain symptoms, theprevalence of new-onset post-COVID pain was 75.9%. Female sex (odds ratio [OR]1.593, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.148-2.211), history of musculoskeletal pain(OR 1.591, 95% CI 1.211-2.07), the presence of myalgia (OR 1.371, 95% CI1.032-1.821) or headache (OR 2.278, 95% CI 1.622-3.199) at hospitalization, thedays of hospitalization (OR 1.013, 95% CI 1.000-1.025), and the presence ofpost-COVID pain at T1 (OR 11.02, 95% CI 8.493-14.305) were factors associatedwith musculoskeletal post-COVID pain 1 year after hospitalization. In conclusion,musculoskeletal post-COVID pain remains highly prevalent 1 year afterhospitalization. Female sex, previous history of pain symptoms, pain symptoms at onset, and days at hospital were factors associated with musculoskeletalpost-COVID pain 1 year after hospitalization.

TI  - Defining a Cesarean Delivery Rate for Optimizing Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004876 [doi]
AB  - After the global cesarean delivery rate nearly doubled between 2000 and 2015,cesarean deliveries now account for nearly one third of births in the UnitedStates. Although rates have plateaued, the high national cesarean delivery ratehas garnered criticism from both lay and academic communities because it has not been associated with improvements in maternal or neonatal outcomes. Efforts areunderway to lower the cesarean delivery rate through implementation ofhospital-level and national guidelines. However, the cesarean delivery rate that optimizes maternal and neonatal outcomes is not known. Defining a cesareandelivery rate that optimizes perinatal outcomes and reduces morbidity seemssimple. However, there are a host of challenges to such a task, includingdetermining the outcomes that are most meaningful to use, deciding the populationthat should define the rate, and incorporating person-centered decision making,given that people place different value on different outcomes. Rather than a"call" for cesarean delivery rate reductions of a specific and arbitrarymagnitude, we need further attention to defining an evidence-based optimaltarget. This commentary summarizes current national and international cesareandelivery rate targets, discusses the challenges of identifying an evidence-based national cesarean delivery rate target, and explores future considerations forbest defining a cesarean delivery rate target.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsexually acquired genital ulcers have been described among girlswho are prepubertal after various viral illnesses due to mucosal inflammationfrom an immunologic response. Until recently, nonsexually acquired genital ulcershave only been associated with viral infections. CASE: We present a case of anadolescent girl developing nonsexually acquired genital ulcers after both herfirst and second coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine doses. Her coursefollowed an expected timeline for severity and resolution of ulcers. CONCLUSIONS:Aphthous ulcers may arise from inflammatory effects of COVID-19 vaccination.Clinical monitoring after COVID-19 vaccination from all formulations shouldinclude assessment for nonsexually acquired genital ulcers if vaginal pain isreported.

TI  - Use of biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons learned from psoriasis.
LID - 10.1080/14712598.2022.2110467 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic has beenextensively investigated. Given the increased infectious risk associated withbiologics, particularly with TNFalpha inhibitors, concerns were raised over thesafety of these agents in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, theimpact of biologics on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was questioned. AREAS COVERED: Inthis review, studies conducted on patients with moderate to severe plaquepsoriasis treated with biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic have been analyzed,including 1) the safety of biologics in psoriatic patients in terms of increased risk and/or worse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection; and 2) whether biologic agentscould affect the safety and response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in psoriaticpatients. EXPERT OPINION: Current evidence indicates that the use of biologics inpsoriatic patients does not seem to be associated with an increased COVID-19infection risk or worse outcome, with TNFalpha inhibitors being even protectiveof severe COVID-19 relative to other treatments or no treatment at all.Furthermore, biologic treatment does not seem to have a significant impact on theresponse and safety of vaccines in patients with psoriasis treated withbiologics. However, uncertainty remains given the limitations of current studies which are often of short duration, limited sample sizes and do not stratify onspecific biologic classes.

TI  - Design and Rationale of the National Tunisian Registry of Percutaneous CoronaryIntervention: Protocol for a Prospective Multicenter Observational Study.
PG  - e24595
LID - 10.2196/24595 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery diseases remain the leading cause of death in theworld. The management of this condition has improved remarkably in the recentyears owing to the development of new technical tools and multicentricregistries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the in-hospitaland 1-year clinical outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronaryintervention (PCI) in Tunisia. METHODS: We will conduct a prospectivemulticentric observational study with patients older than 18 years who underwent PCI between January 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020. The primary end point is theoccurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event, defined as cardiovasculardeath, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or target vesselrevascularization with either repeat PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG). The secondary end points are procedural success rate, stent thrombosis,and the rate of redo PCI/CABG for in-stent restenosis. RESULTS: In this study,the demographic profile and the general risk profile of Tunisian patients whounderwent PCI and their end points will be analyzed. The complexity level of the procedures and the left main occlusion, bifurcation occlusion, and chronic total occlusion PCI will be analyzed, and immediate as well as long-term results willbe determined. The National Tunisian Registry of PCI (NATURE-PCI) will be thefirst national multicentric registry of angioplasty in Africa. For this study,the institutional ethical committee approval was obtained (0223/2020). This trialconsists of 97 cardiologists and 2498 patients who have undergone PCI with a1-year follow-up period. Twenty-eight catheterization laboratories from bothpublic (15 laboratories) and private (13 laboratories) sectors will enrollpatients after receiving informed consent. Of the 2498 patients, 1897 (75.9%) aremanaged in the public sector and 601 (24.1%) are managed in the private sector.The COVID-19 pandemic started in Tunisia in March 2020; 719 patients (31.9%) wereincluded before the COVID-19 pandemic and 1779 (60.1%) during the pandemic. Theinclusion of patients has been finished, and we expect to publish the results by the end of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study would add data and provide a valuableopportunity for real-world clinical epidemiology and practice in the field ofinterventional cardiology in Tunisia with insights into the uptake of PCI in thislimited-income region.

TI  - Risk and Resilience Pathways, Community Adversity, Decision-making, and AlcoholUse Among Appalachian Adolescents: Protocol for the Longitudinal YoungMountaineer Health Study Cohort.
PG  - e40451

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use impairs psychosocial and neurocognitive development andincreases the vulnerability of youth to academic failure, substance usedisorders, and other mental health problems. The early onset of alcohol use inadolescents is of particular concern, forecasting substance abuse in lateradolescence and adulthood. To date, evidence suggests that youth in rural areasare especially vulnerable to contextual and community factors that contribute to the early onset of alcohol use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the Young MountaineerHealth Study is to investigate the influence of contextual and health behaviorvariables on the early onset of alcohol use among middle school-aged youth inresource-poor Appalachian rural communities. METHODS: This is a program ofprospective cohort studies of approximately 2200 middle school youth from a rangeof 20 rural, small town, and small city (population <30,000) public schools inWest Virginia. Students are participating in 6 waves of data collection (2 peryear) over the course of middle school (sixth to eighth grades; fall and spring) from 2020 to 2023. On the basis of an organizational arrangement, which includes a team of local data collection leaders, supervising contact agents in schools,and an honest broker system to deidentify data linked via school IDs, we are ableto collect novel forms of data (self-reported data, teacher-reported data,census-linked area data, and archival school records) while ensuring high ratesof participation by a large majority of youth in each participating school.RESULTS: In the spring of 2021, 3 waves of student survey data, 2 waves of datafrom teachers, and a selection of archival school records were collected. Studentsurvey wave 1 comprised 1349 (response rate 80.7%) participants, wave 2 comprised1649 (response rate 87%) participants, and wave 3 comprised 1909 (response rate83.1%) participants. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on thesampling frame size, resulting in a reduced number of eligible students,particularly during the fall of 2020. Nevertheless, our team structure andincentive system have proven vitally important in mitigating the potentially far greater negative impact of the pandemic on our data collection processes.CONCLUSIONS: The Young Mountaineer Health Study will use a large data set to testpathways linking rural community disadvantage to alcohol misuse among earlyadolescents. Furthermore, the program will test hypotheses regarding contextualfactors (eg, parenting practices and neighborhood collective efficacy) thatprotect youth from community disadvantage and explore alcohol antecedents in the onset of nicotine, marijuana, and other drug use. Data collection efforts havebeen successful despite interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and2021. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/40451.

AB  - The prefatory protein-glycan interaction and stabilizing protein-proteininteraction of severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses withangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 play a significant role in complex formationthereby promoting endocytosis. The microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 over a period of time has a significant role in increasing the affinity of receptor-binding domainagainst angiotensin converting-enzyme 2. In this study, we have corroborated the vitality of acquired SNPs over a period of time with increased affinity by using docking studies. The results indicate that the virus modulates the undesirableglycosylation sites by a series of substitution and deletion mutations. It usesbulky residues such as Tyr/Phe for dynamic arrest for quick stabilization of the complex, and Lys residues for stabilizing via hydrogen bond formation besidesincreasing the binding affinity to ease the cell entry.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Nowadays, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, consumers increasingly seek foodsthat not only fulfill the basic need (i.e., satisfying hunger) but also enhancehuman health and well-being. As a result, more attention has been given to somekinds of foods, termed "superfoods," making big claims about their richness invaluable nutrients and bioactive compounds as well as their capability to preventillness, reinforcing the human immune system, and improve overall health.Thisreview is an attempt to uncover truths and myths about superfoods by givingexamples of the most popular foods (e.g., berries, pomegranates, watermelon,olive, green tea, several seeds and nuts, honey, salmon, and camel milk, amongmany others) that are commonly reported as having unique nutritional,nutraceutical, and functional characteristics.While superfoods have become apopular buzzword in blog articles and social media posts, scientific publicationsare still relatively marginal. The reviewed findings show that COVID-19 hasbecome a significant driver for superfoods consumption. Food Industry 4.0innovations have revolutionized many sectors of food technologies, including the manufacturing of functional foods, offering new opportunities to improve thesensory and nutritional quality of such foods. Although many food products havebeen considered superfoods and intensively sought by consumers, scientificevidence for their beneficial effectiveness and their "superpower" are yet to be provided. Therefore, more research and collaboration between researchers,industry, consumers, and policymakers are still needed to differentiate factsfrom marketing gimmicks and promote human health and nutrition.

AB  - The food industry has recently been under unprecedented pressure due to majorglobal challenges, such as climate change, exponential increase in worldpopulation and urbanization, and the worldwide spread of new diseases andpandemics, such as the COVID-19. The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) has been gaining momentum since 2015 and has revolutionized the way in which foodis produced, transported, stored, perceived, and consumed worldwide, leading tothe emergence of new food trends. After reviewing Industry 4.0 technologies (e.g.artificial intelligence, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet ofThings) in Part I of this work (Hassoun, Ait-Kaddour, et al. 2022. The fourthindustrial revolution in the food industry-Part I: Industry 4.0 technologies.Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 1-17.), this complimentary reviewwill focus on emerging food trends (such as fortified and functional foods,additive manufacturing technologies, cultured meat, precision fermentation, andpersonalized food) and their connection with Industry 4.0 innovations.Implementation of new food trends has been associated with recent advances inIndustry 4.0 technologies, enabling a range of new possibilities. The resultsshow several positive food trends that reflect increased awareness of food chain actors of the food-related health and environmental impacts of food systems.Emergence of other food trends and higher consumer interest and engagement in thetransition toward sustainable food development and innovative green strategiesare expected in the future.

AB  - In the present study, we screened eighty seven novel phytochemical compounds fromfour popular herbs, such as, Aegle Marmelos, Coleus Amboinicus, Aerva Lanata and Biophytum Sensitivum and identified the best three for targeting the mainprotease (M(pro)) receptor of SARS-CoV-2. After categorizing all thephytochemicals based upon LibDock scores and hydrogen bonding interactions, thetop ranked 26 compounds were further subjected for detailed Molecular dynamics(MD) study. From these screening we identified that Aegelinosides B leads thelist with a high LibDock value of 142.50 (binding energy: -8.54 kcal/mol), which is better than several popular reference compounds namely, Tipranavir (LibDockscore, 141.50), Saquinavir (125.34), Zopicole (122.9), Pirenepine (122.70),(115.37), Metixene (109.18), Oxiconazole Pimozide (138.00) and Rimonabant(91.88). Detailed analysis for structural stability (RMSD), Calpha fluctuations(RMSF), intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions, effect of solventaccessibility (SASA) and compactness (Rg) factors were performed for the best sixcompounds and it is found that they are very stable and exhibit folding behavior.Apart from the docking and MD tests, through further drug-likeness and toxicitytests, three compounds, such as, Aegelinosides B, Epicatechin, andFeruloyltyramine (LibDock scores, respectively, 142.50, 124.33 and 129.06) can besuggested for fighting SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nafamostat mesilate (NM), a broad-spectrum and potent serine proteaseinhibitor, can be used as an anticoagulant during extracorporeal circulation, as well as a promising drug effective against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We conducted a systematic meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NMadministration in critically ill patients who underwent blood purificationtherapy (BPT). METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PubMed werecomprehensively searched from inception to August 20, 2021, for potentialstudies. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and sevenobservational studies with 2723 patients met the inclusion criteria. Themeta-analysis demonstrated that conventional therapy (CT) significantly increasedhospital mortality compared with NM administration (RR = 1.25, p = 0.0007). Insubgroup analyses, the in-hospital mortality of the NM group was significantlylower than that of the anticoagulant-free (NA) group (RR = 1.31, p = 0.002). The CT interventions markedly elevated the risk ratio of bleeding complications by45% (RR = 1.45, p = 0.010) compared with NM interventions. In another subgroupanalysis, NM used exhibited a significantly lower risk of bleeding complications than those of the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used (RR = 4.58, p =0.020). The filter lifespan was decreased significantly (MD = -10.59, p < 0.0001)in the NA groups compared with the NM groups. Due to the poor quality of theincluded RCTs, these results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSION:Given the better survival outcomes, lower risk of bleeding, NM anticoagulationseems to be a safe and efficient approach for BPT patients and could yield afavorable filter lifespan. More multi-center RCTs with large samples are requiredfor further validation of this study.

AB  - Even after virus elimination, numerous sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) persist. Based on accumulating evidence, large amounts ofproinflammatory cytokines are released to drive COVID-19 progression, severity,and mortality, and their levels remain elevated after the acute phase ofCOVID-19, playing a central role in the disease' sequelae. In this manner,bronchial epithelial cells are the first cells hyperactivated by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to massive cytokinerelease, triggering the hyperactivation of leukocytes and other cells, andmediating COVID-19 sequelae. Therefore, proinflammatory cytokine production isinitiated by the host. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis thatImmuneRecov, a nutritional blend, inhibits the SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperactivationof human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). BEAS-2B (5x10(4)/mL/well) cellswere cocultivated with 1 ml of blood from a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient for 4 h, and the nutritional blend (1 microg/mL) was added in the first minute ofcoculture. After 4 h, the cells were recovered and used for analyses ofcytotoxicity with the (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide) (MTT) assay and the expression of the IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNAs.The supernatant was collected to measure cytokine levels. SARS-CoV-2 incubationresulted in increased levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 in BEAS-2B cells (p < 0.001).Treatment with the nutritional blend resulted in reduced levels of theproinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 (p < 0.001) and increased levels ofthe anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p < 0.001). Additionally, the nutritionalblend reduced the expression of the IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNAs inSARS-CoV-2-stimulated cells and increased the expression of the IL-10 andIFN-gamma mRNAs. In conclusion, the nutritional blend exerts importantanti-inflammatory effects on cells in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Importance: SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has displayedperson-to-person transmission in a variety of indoor situations. This potentialfor robust transmission has posed significant challenges and concerns forday-to-day activities of colleges and universities where indoor learning is afocus for students, faculty, and staff. Objective: To assess whether in-classinstruction without any physical distancing, but with other public healthmitigation strategies, is a risk for driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Design,Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined the evidence for SARS-CoV-2transmission on a large urban US university campus using contact tracing, classattendance, and whole genome sequencing during the 2021 fall semester. Eligibleparticipants were on-campus and off-campus individuals involved in campusactivities. Data were analyzed between September and December 2021. Exposures:Participation in class and work activities on a campus with mandated vaccination and indoor masking but that was otherwise fully open without physical distancing during a time of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, both at the university andin the surrounding counties. Main Outcomes and Measures: Likelihood of in-classinfection was assessed by measuring the genetic distance between all potentialin-class transmission pairings using polymerase chain reaction testing. Results: More than 600000 polymerase chain reaction tests were conducted throughout thesemester, with 896 tests (0.1%) showing detectable SARS-CoV-2; there were over850 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified through weekly surveillance testing of all students and faculty on campus during the fall 2021 semester. The rolling mean average of positive tests ranged between 4 and 27 daily cases. Of more than 140000 in-person class events and a total student population of 33000 betweengraduate and undergraduate students, only 9 instances of potential in-classtransmission were identified, accounting for 0.0045% of all classroom meetings.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, the data suggested that underrobust transmission abatement strategies, in-class instruction was not anappreciable source of disease transmission.

LID - 10.1080/17474086.2022.2110061 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is associated to an increased risk of thrombosis, as aresult of a complex process that involves the activation of vascular andcirculating cells, the release of soluble inflammatory and thrombotic mediatorsand blood clotting activation. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews thepathophysiological role of platelets, neutrophils and the endothelium, and oftheir interactions, in the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 patients, and thecurrent and future therapeutic approaches targeting these cell types. EXPERTOPINION: Virus-induced platelet, neutrophil and endothelial cell changes arecrucial triggers of the thrombotic complications and of the adverse evolution of COVID-19. Both the direct interaction with the virus and the associated cytokine storm concur to trigger cell activation in a classical thromboinflammatoryvicious circle. Although heparin has proven to be an effective prophylactic andtherapeutic weapon for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19-associatedthrombosis, it acts downstream of the cascade of events triggered by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of specific molecular targets interrupting thethromboinflammatory cascade upstream, and more specifically acting either on the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with blood and vascular cells or on the specificsignalling mechanisms associated with their COVID-19-associated activation, mighttheoretically offer greater protection with potentially lesser side effects.

AB  - To prevent interhuman transmission of viruses, new mask types horizontal lineclaiming improved filtration horizontal line require careful performancecharacterization. Here, a microfluidic spray device that can effectively simulatedroplets emitted during coughing or sneezing was developed to spray dropletscontaining gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that mimic SARS-CoV-2 to overcome theshortcomings associated with using biosamples. The light scattered by the AuNPspassing through the mask is successfully analyzed by using an automatedscattering light mapping system within a duration of 2 min, thereby enablinghigh-throughput analysis of the filtering efficiency of various types ofcommercial masks. The differences in efficiency in terms of same mask type fromdifferent manufacturers, double masking, and prolonged usage, which arechallenging to analyze with conventional testing systems, can also be assessed.AuNP-mediated mask performance evaluation enables the rapid determination of maskefficiency according to particle size and can contribute to the rapid response tocounter new emerging infectious biohazards.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been declared a globalpandemic. COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury (COVID-19 AKI) is related to a high mortality rate and serves as an independent risk factor for hospital deathin patients with COVID-19. Early diagnosis would allow for earlier interventionand potentially improve patient outcomes. The goal of early identification of AKIhas been the primary impetus for AKI biomarker research, and several kidneyinjury biomarkers have been demonstrated to be beneficial in predicting COVID-19 AKI as well as disease progression in COVID-19. Furthermore, such data providevaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex andunique disease and serve as a molecular phenotyping tool that could be utilizedto direct clinical intervention. This review focuses on a number of kidney injurybiomarkers, such as CysC, NAGAL, KIM-1, L-FABP, IL-18, suPAR, and [TIMP-2] *[IGFBP7], which have been widely studied in common clinical settings, such assepsis, cardiac surgery, and contrast-induced AKI. We explore the role of kidney injury biomarkers in COVID-19 and discuss what remains to be learned.

Poststratification survey weights were used, and logistic and linearregression models estimated associations between demographics and telelactationuse. Results: Among 1,617 respondents, 33.8% had at least one telelactationvisit. Odds of any telelactation visit(s) were greater for parents who gave birthin 2021 versus 2019 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.26-2.25), insured by Medicaid (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.02-2.02), and youngerparents (OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.32-3.34). In total, 56.0% agreed that they would be comfortable breastfeeding over video to get help, and 27.6% agreed that lactationsupport over video is as good as in-person support. Conclusions: Telelactation isincreasingly common and acceptable to many parents.

TI  - The Role of Lymphocyte Subsets, PD-1, and FAS (CD95) in COVID-19 Cancer Patients.
LID - 10.1089/vim.2022.0036 [doi]
AB  - Lymphocytes are the main orchestrators that regulate the immune response inSARS-COV-2 infection. The exhaustion of T lymphocytes is a contributing factor tolymphopenia, which is responsible for the COVID-19 adverse outcome. However, itis still not demonstrated on a large scale, including cancer patients. Peripheralblood samples were obtained from 83 SARS-CoV2 infected cancer patients, and 29COVID-19 infected noncancer patients compared to 28 age-matched healthy controls.Lymphocyte subsets were assessed for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, PD-1, and CD95 usingflow cytometry. The data were correlated to the patients' clinical features,COVID-19 severity and outcomes. Lymphopenia, and decreased CD4(+) T cells andCD8(+) T cells were significantly observed in COVID-19 cancer and noncancerpatients compared to the control group (p < 0.001, for all). There was asignificantly increased expression of CD95 and PD-1 on the NK cells, CD4(+) Tcells, and CD8(+) T cells in COVID-19 cancer and noncancer patients in comparisonto the control group. The increased expression of CD95 on CD8(+) T cells, as wellas the increased expression of PD-1 on CD8(+) T cells and NK cells aresignificantly associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection in cancerpatients. The increased expression of CD95 and PD-1 on the CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+)T cells, and NK cells was observed significantly in nonsurviving patients andthose who were admitted to the intensive care unit in COVID-19 cancer andnoncancer patients. The increased expression of PD-1 and CD95 could be possibleprognostic factors for COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 cancer and noncancer patients.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated with Loss to Follow-up Among Transgender Women Receiving HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis in Chiang Mai province, Thailand.
LID - 10.1007/s10461-022-03782-7 [doi]
AB  - Although HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is free in Thailand, manytransgender women discontinue taking it after initiation. We determined the loss to follow-up (LTFU) rate of transgender women who initiated PrEP at the MplusFoundation, Chiang Mai, Thailand, and identified associated risk factors usingCox proportional hazard models. Of 235 participants who initiated PrEP, 59 (55%) out of 108 remaining participants had reactive syphilis. The LTFU rate at 6months was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-48%). Multivariable analysisindicates that LTFU is independently associated with age >/= 26 years old(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.06-4.14) and reactive syphilis(aHR = 1.98; 95% CI:1.01-3.88). Delayed appointment scheduling by the PrEPproviders and the syphilis clinic was associated with transgender women havingreactive syphilis, and the lockdown policy during the COVID-19 pandemic mighthave influenced them to discontinue PrEP and their subsequent LTFU.

TI  - Jacareubin inhibits TLR4-induced lung inflammatory response caused by the RBDdomain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.
LID - 10.1007/s43440-022-00398-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, has been a major public health problem worldwide in the last 2 years. SARS-CoV-2-dependentactivation of innate immune receptors contributes to the strong local andsystemic inflammatory reaction associated with rapid disease evolution. Thereceptor-binding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) viral protein (S-RBD) is essential forvirus infection and its interacting molecules in target cells are still underidentification. On the other hand, the search for accessible natural moleculeswith potential therapeutic use has been intense and remains an active field ofinvestigation. METHODS: C57BL6/J (control) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-deficient (Lps del) mice were nebulized with recombinant S-RBD. Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin (IL)-6 production in bronchoalveolarlavages (BALs) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Lung-infiltrating cells recovered in BALs were quantified by hematoxylin-eosin(H&E) stain. In selected groups of animals, the natural compound Jacareubin ordexamethasone were intraperitoneally (ip) administered 2 hours beforenebulization. RESULTS: A rapid lung production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 and cellinfiltration was induced by S-RBD nebulization in control but not in Lps delmice. Pre-treatment with Jacareubin or dexamethasone prevented S-RBD-inducedTNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion in BALs from control animals. CONCLUSIONS: S-RBDdomain promotes lung TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in a TLR4-dependent fashion inC57BL6/J mice. Xanthone Jacareubin possesses potential anti-COVID-19 propertiesthat, together with the previously tested anti-inflammatory activity, safety, andtolerance, make it a valuable drug to be further investigated for the treatmentof cytokine production caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - COVID-19 Outcomes and Risk Factors Among People Living with HIV.
LID - 10.1007/s11904-022-00618-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we examine the intersection of the HIV andCOVID-19 epidemics with focus on COVID-19-related health outcomes and riskfactors for SARS-CoV-2 among people living with HIV (PLWH). RECENT FINDINGS:Evidence to date do not suggest a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH compared to the general population, although-once exposed-PLWH are atgreater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Key risk factors for severe COVID-19include non-HIV comorbidities known to be associated with severe disease, as wellas HIV-specific risk factors such as low CD4 + T-cell count, unsuppressed viralload, and tuberculosis co-infection. The disproportionate impact of theSARS-CoV-2 pandemic among Black, Latinx, and Native American/Alaskan Native PLWH could worsen pre-existing disparities in health outcomes among PLWH. Data onSARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection among PLWH needs additional study, although somestudies suggest decreased humoral responses among those with low CD4 + T-cellcounts, while there is a signal of increased vaccine breakthrough rates amongPLWH in two large observational cohorts. Data on post-acute sequelae ofSARS-CoV-2 (PASC) among PLWH is also limited. PLWH do not have a highersusceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, but once exposed, they are at higher risk of severeCOVID-19 outcomes. Additional resources will need to be dedicated to thedevelopment of interventions to improve health outcomes and address disparitiesamong PLWH impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Handgrip strength is associated with adverse outcomes in patients hospitalizedfor COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
LID - 10.1007/s11739-022-03060-3 [doi]
AB  - Handgrip strength (HGS), a simple tool for the evaluation of muscular strength,is independently associated with negative prognosis in many diseases. It isunknown whether HGS is prognostically relevant in COVID-19. We evaluated theability of HGS to predict clinical outcomes in people with COVID-19-relatedpneumonia. 118 patients (66% men, 63 +/- 12 years), consecutively hospitalized tothe "Santa Maria" Terni University Hospital for COVID-19-related pneumonia andrespiratory failure, underwent HGS measurement (Jamar hand-dynamometer) at wardadmission. HGS was normalized to weight(2/3) (nHGS) The main end-point was thefirst occurrence of death and/or endotracheal intubation at 14 days. Twenty-twopatients reached the main end-point. In the Kaplan-Meyer analysis, the Log ranktest showed significant differences between subjects with lower than mean HGSnormalized to weight(2/3) (nHGS) (< 1.32 kg/Kg(2/3)) vs subjects with higher thanmean nHGS. (p = 0.03). In a Cox-proportional hazard model, nHGS inverselypredicted the main end-point (hazard ratio, HR = 1.99 each 0.5 kg/Kg(2/3)decrease, p = 0.03), independently from age, sex, body mass index, ratio ofpartial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2ratio), hypertension, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate and history of previous cardiovascular cardiovascular disease. These two latter also showedindependent association with the main end-point (HR 1.30, p = 0.03 and 3.89, p < 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, nHGS measured at hospital admission,independently and inversely predicts the risk of poor outcomes in people withCOVID-19-related pneumonia. The evaluation of HGS may be useful in earlystratifying the risk of adverse prognosis in COVID-19.

TI  - Predictors of "brain fog" 1 year after COVID-19 disease.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06285-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Brain fog has been described up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2infection, notwithstanding the underlying mechanisms are still poorlyinvestigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of cognitivecomplaints at 1-year follow-up and to identify the factors related to persistent brain fog in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Out of 246 COVID patients, hospitalized from March 1st to May 31st, a sample of 137 patients accepted to be evaluated at 1 year from discharge, through a full clinical, neurological, and psychologicalexamination, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), impact of event scale-revised (IES-R), Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS), Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and fatigue severity scale (FSS). Subjects with priorcognitive impairment and/or psychiatric disorders were excluded. RESULTS:Patients with cognitive disorders exhibited lower MoCA score (22.9 +/- 4.3 vs.26.3 +/- 3.1, p = 0.002) and higher IES-R score (33.7 +/- 18.5 vs. 26.4 +/- 16.3,p = 0.050), SDS score (40.9 +/- 6.5 vs. 35.5 +/- 8.6, p = 0.004), and fatigueseverity scale score (33.6 +/- 16.1 vs. 23.7 +/- 12.5, p = 0.001), compared topatients without cognitive complaints. Logistic regression showed a significantcorrelation between brain fog and the self-rating depression scale values (p =0.020), adjusted for age (p = 0.445), sex (p = 0.178), premorbid CumulativeIllness Rating Scale (CIRS) (p = 0.288), COVID-19 severity (BCRSS) (p = 0.964),education level (p = 0.784) and MoCA score (p = 0.909). CONCLUSIONS: Our studyshowed depression as the strongest predictor of persistent brain fog, adjustingfor demographic and clinical variables. Wider longitudinal studies are warranted to better explain cognitive difficulties after COVID-19.

TI  - The COVID-19 pandemic and children with PANS/PANDAS: an evaluation of symptomseverity, telehealth, and vaccination hesitancy.
LID - 10.1007/s10578-022-01401-z [doi]
AB  - The current study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children withPANS/PANDAS, a condition characterized by sudden-onset obsessive-compulsive, tic,or restrictive eating symptoms following infection. We conducted an anonymoussurvey between February and June 2021 of 254 self-reported caregivers of minorswith PANS/PANDAS. Caregivers answered questions regarding PANS/PANDAS symptoms,telehealth care, and intention to vaccinate their child against COVID-19.PANS/PANDAS symptoms during COVID-19 infections were assessed when applicable.Children's OCD symptoms and coercive behaviors towards caregivers, along with thecaregivers' mental health, relationship satisfaction, and burden, were assessedusing standardized questionnaires. A majority of respondents endorsed a negative impact on their child's friendships, relationships with extended family, hobbies,and academic skills due to the pandemic. Children with suspected or diagnosedCOVID-19 experienced new or worsened psychiatric symptoms, particularly moodlability, OCD, and anxiety. Telehealth care was the preferred treatment modality if the child had mild symptoms of PANS/PANDAS. A majority of caregivers reported high levels of relationship dissatisfaction and caregiver burden. As expected,these data suggest an overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic onchildren with PANS/PANDAS and their caregivers.

TI  - Continuity and change in loneliness and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: Alongitudinal study of autistic and non-autistic adults.
LID - 10.1002/aur.2787 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that autistic adults may be negatively affectedby the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions. In this study, weexamined continuity and change in loneliness and stress, and their predictors, in448 autistic and 70 non-autistic adults living in the Netherlands. Autisticparticipants were assessed on three occasions using the de Jong GierveldLoneliness Scale and Perceived Stress Scale (pre-lockdown (T0), first lockdown(T1), and second lockdown (T2)); non-autistic participants were assessed twice(T1 and T2). Autistic adults' loneliness and stress levels remained stable acrossall three time points over 8 months, but were consistently higher than those ofnon-autistic adults. Other predictors of higher loneliness and stress levels atthe first lockdown (T1) included low perceived social support and high levels of COVID-19 related worries. Although loneliness and stress were stable at the grouplevel, the wellbeing of some autistic adults worsened over the course of thepandemic, while others improved. For instance, adults with a mental healthdiagnosis (other than autism) prior to the pandemic were more likely to increase in stress over time, whereas adults with higher perceived social support weremore likely to decrease in stress over time (from T1 to T2). Factors contributingto variability in outcome require further examination. Moreover, the relativelyhigh loneliness and stress levels in autistic adults call for attention fromclinicians and service providers. LAY SUMMARY: In our study, autistic adultsreported feeling more lonely and stressed than non-autistic adults during theCOVID-19 pandemic. People who missed support from their social network also felt more lonely and stressed. On average, people did not change substantially intheir degree of loneliness or stress over time. Yet, we noted largeperson-to-person differences in the wellbeing of autistic adults during thepandemic.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 pharmaceutical drugs: a critical review on the environmental impacts, chemical characteristics, and behavior of advanced oxidation processes in water.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22234-2 [doi]
AB  - This review summarizes research data on the pharmaceutical drugs used to treatthe novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, their characteristics, environmental impacts, and theadvanced oxidation processes (AOP) applied to remove them. A literature surveywas conducted using the electronic databases Science Direct, Scopus, Taylor &Francis, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Springer. This complete research includesand discusses relevant studies that involve the introduction, pharmaceuticaldrugs used in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: chemical characteristics and environmentalimpact, advanced oxidation process (AOP), future trends and discussion, andconclusions. The results show a full approach in the versatility of AOPs as apromising solution to minimize the environmental impact associated with thesecompounds by the fact that they offer different ways for hydroxyl radicalproduction. Moreover, this article focuses on introducing the fundamentals ofeach AOP, the main parameters involved, and the concomitance with other sourcesand modifications over the years. Photocatalysis, sonochemical technologies,electro-oxidation, photolysis, Fenton reaction, ozone, and sulfate radical AOPhave been used to mineralize SARS-CoV-2 pharmaceutical compounds, and theefficiencies are greater than 65%. According to the results, photocatalysis isthe main technology currently applied to remove these pharmaceuticals. Thisprocess has garnered attention because solar energy can be directly utilized;however, low photocatalytic efficiencies and high costs in large-scale practical applications limit its use. Furthermore, pharmaceuticals in the environment arediverse and complex. Finally, the review also provides ideas for further researchneeds and major concerns.

TI  - COVID-19 and antiepileptic drugs: an approach to guide practices whennirmatrelvir/ritonavir is co-prescribed.
LID - 10.1007/s00228-022-03370-7 [doi]
AB  - Management and dose adjustment are a major concern for clinicians in the absence of specific clinical outcome data for patients on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), in the event of short-term (5 days) nirmatrelvir/ritonavir co-exposure. Therefore,in this report, we identified drugs that require dose adjustment because ofdrug-drug interactions (DDIs) between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and AEDs. We hereby used four databases (Micromedex Drug Interaction, Liverpool Drug InteractionGroup for COVID-19 Therapies, Medscape Drug Interaction Checker, and LexicompDrug Interactions) and DDI-Predictor.In the light of applying the DDI-Predictor, for carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, phenytoin,phenobarbital, pentobarbital, rufinamide, and valproate as CYP3A4 inducers, werecommend that a dose adjustment of short-term nirmatrelvir/ritonavir as asubstrate (victim) drug would be more appropriate instead of these AEDs to avoid impending DDI-related threats in patients with epilepsy.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the presence and genotyping of Acanthamoeba spp.,in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of immunocompetent patients withchronic respiratory disorders (CRD). In this study, 211 BALF samples werecollected from patients with CRD during the COVID-19 pandemic who were candidatesfor fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) at Imam Khomeini Hospital, Sari, MazandaranProvince, northern Iran and investigated for Acanthamoeba spp., by PCR. A totalof 211 FBAL samples were examined; 5 (5/211; 2.36%) were positive by using thePCR test for Acanthamoeba spp. According to sequence analysis, three strainsbelonged to the T4 genotype and one strain to the T2 genotype. Our datademonstrate that the presence of Acanthamoeba (T4 and T2) in BALF specimens ofpatients with respiratory infections. However, it is important to note that thesefindings may be merely accidental. Our findings suggest further investigation to fully understand the role of Acanthamoeba spp. in the pathogenesis of lunginfections.

AB  - This study aims to examine how the process of online support obtainment mayaffect cognitive and behavioral coping during a public crisis. A cross-sectional online survey (N = 555) was conducted during the early stage of the COVID-19pandemic in the U.S. Our findings revealed that informational support, obtainedprimarily through passive and private online involvement, led to increased riskperceptions of COVID-19; emotional support, obtained mainly via private onlineinvolvement, appeared to elicit higher perceived efficacy to cope with thecrisis. People's engagement in preventive behaviors was found to be affected byefficacy perceptions, but not by risk perceptions. The results suggested thatonline social support functioned as a double-edged sword to affect people'scoping with a public crisis.

TI  - First trimester COVID-19 and the risk of major congenitalmalformations-International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy.
LID - 10.1002/bdr2.2070 [doi]
AB  - There is limited information about the effects of severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the first trimester ofpregnancy on the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs). The InternationalRegistry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) was designed to estimatethe relative risk of adverse perinatal outcomes among women with CoronavirusDisease 2019 (COVID-19) at specific times during gestation. Adult women wereeligible to enroll if they had a SARS-CoV-2 test, regardless of the results, orclinically confirmed COVID-19 during pregnancy. Self-administered questionnaires collected data on SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnancy outcomes (including detailedquestions on MCMs), and potential confounders. The analysis of MCMs includeswomen with either a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test or a clinical diagnosis ofCOVID-19 during the first trimester (exposed group) or a negative SARS-CoV-2 test(reference) that enrolled while pregnant. Sensitivity analyses were restricted toparticipants who enrolled before the availability of informative prenatalscreening tests and extended to those enrolled after end of pregnancy.Generalized linear models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95%confidence intervals (CI). Of 17,163 participants enrolled between June 2020 and July 2021, 1727 had a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first trimester, of whom1,675 enrolled during pregnancy. Of 10,235 controls with a negative test duringpregnancy, 4,172 enrolled during pregnancy. Restriction to participants withcomplete follow-up reduced the sample size to 92 exposed and 292 unexposedreference pregnancies. MCMs were reported in 3 (3.3%) exposed and 8 (2.7%)unexposed (RR 1.2; 95% CI 0.32-4.2) newborns. The RR was 2.5 (95%CI 0.23-27)among those enrolled before prenatal screening, and 2.2 (95%CI 0.89-5.3) in theoverall study population including those enrolled post-pregnancy. No specificpattern of malformations was observed. Although results are compatible with nomajor teratogenic effects associated with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, RRestimates were imprecise and larger studies are warranted.

AB  - Pleasure and protagonism are two words that define Maria de Jesus Almeida Costa, or Dije, as friends call her. She was just an adolescent when she first arrivedin the Sao Luiz red light district and began to fight against the violence andinjustice she witnessed. Today, she is 62 years old and the leader of the sexworker movement in the Brazilian state of Maranhao, in the Northeast region ofthe country. She is widely recognised for her tireless fight for the preservationof the historical centre of Sao Luiz where the red light district remains to thisday, and where Jesus also raised her children and lives to this day. In thisinterview, Jesus talks about the pleasures and dangers of prostitution, her fightagainst racism and sex work stigma, her relationship with the academy andresearchers, the alliances and partnerships she mobilised during the Covid-19pandemic and the challenges that she is facing in Brazil's current conservative, far-right government.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A correlation between new coronaviruses and host immunity, as well as the role of defective immune function in host response, would be extremelyhelpful in understanding coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pathogenicity, and acoherent structure of treatments and vaccines. As existing vaccines may beinadequate for new viral variants emerging in various regions of the world, it isa vital requirement for fresh and effective therapeutic alternatives. AREACOVERED: Immunotherapy may give a viable protective option for COVID-19, adisease that is currently a big burden on global health and economic systems.Herein, we have outlined three dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines for COVID-19which are in human clinical trials and have shown encouraging outcomes. EXPERTOPINION: With existing knowledge of the virus, and the nature of DC, DC-basedvaccines may be proven to be effective in inducing long-lasting protectiveimmunity, especially T cell responses.

TI  - Predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study from Jordan.
LID - 10.1080/17476348.2022.2108796 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify early indicators for invasive mechanical ventilationutilization among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated COVID-19 patients who were admitted to hospital from September 20, 2020, toAugust 8, 2021. Patients' clinical characteristics, demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory results were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression andmachine learning (ML) methods were employed to assess variable significance.RESULTS: Among 1,613 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 365 patients (22.6%) receivedinvasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Factors associated with IMV included olderage >65 years (OR,1.46; 95%CI, 1.13 - 1.89), current smoking status (OR, 1.71;95%CI, 1.22-2.41), critical disease at admission (OR, 1.97; 95%CI, 1.28-3.03),and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.07; 95%CI, 1.37-3.13). Laboratory abnormalitiesthat were associated with increased risk for IMV included high leukocyte count(OR, 2.19; 95%CI, 1.68 - 2.87), low albumin (OR, 1.76; 95%CI, 1.33 - 2.34) andhigh AST (OR, 1.71; 95%CI, 1.31 - 2.22). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests thatthere are several factors associated with the increased need for IMV amongCOVID-19 patients including older age, current smoking status, critical diseasestatus on admission, and chronic kidney disease. In addition, laboratory markers such as high leukocyte count, low albumin and high AST were determined. Thesefindings will help in early identification of patients at high risk for IMV andreallocation of hospital resources towards patients who need them the most toimprove their outcomes.

TI  - Treatment delay and treatment pattern modifications among epithelial ovariancancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1002/jso.27048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemicdisrupted healthcare access and medical treatment, including oncological care.Treatment delay in ovarian cancer could impact survival. We aimed to assess ifthere were delays and treatment changes in a cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer patientsincluded cases diagnosed during the first 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic inthe state of Sao Paulo and those diagnosed in the 22 months preceding theoutbreak. Time-to-treat was measured in days. In each group, surgery andchemotherapy proportions were assessed according to healthcare insurance status. RESULTS: A 56.2% reduction in epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis was identified during the pandemic group compared to the prepandemic group; fewer patients were diagnosed in stage I (p < 0.01). Time-to-treat increased from 18.9 to 23 days (p < 0.01). Surgery in the public sector fell from 74.6% to 65.3% during thepandemic, compared to 87.1% to 68.8% in the private sector. CONCLUSION: Therewere fewer overall diagnoses, reduced stage I diagnosis, increased time-to-treat,and a reduction in the proportion of patients submitted to surgery. Brazil'spublic healthcare system demonstrated a higher resiliency to treatment changethan the private sector.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there has been a reduction in theprovision of all elective services. This poses enormous pressure on urologists asregards to patients with bladder cancer who need intravesical Bacille CalmetteGuerin (BCG) treatment. The evolving situation of the pandemic mandates apragmatic approach in clinical decisions; to date, there are no uniform consensusguidelines about how to manage these patients and the factors affecting ourdecision for service provision. These concerns need to be addressed not only for the current crisis but also for the upcoming next phase of the pandemic.

LID - 10.5152/tud.2020.20179 [doi]
AB  - In this rapid review, we aimed to evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) on renal functions and mortality of patients with kidney diseases. We searched MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, UpToDate,and TRIP databases using the following keywords: COVID-19, COVID19, 2019-nCoV,2019-CoV, coronavirus, SARS-nCoV-2, urology, cancer, bladder, prostate, kidney,trauma, stone, neurogenic, and reconstructive. The initial search resulted in 495records. After the primary screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts andremoving duplicates, 10 articles were selected and included in this rapid review.Moreover, we performed meta-analysis of binary data for the outcomes withsufficient data. Owing to a high level of heterogeneity because of differentstudy designs and contexts, we used a random model for the meta-analysis. Only 5 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. In these studies, comprising 964COVID-19 positive patients, the cumulative event rate of acute kidney injury(AKI) was 7.1% (95% confidence interval: 1.8%-24.5%, p<0.001, I2=92.4). Based on the qualitative synthesis of the 10 included studies, patients with COVID-19 and kidney diseases had higher risk of in-hospital mortality. If AKI occurs becauseof the novel coronavirus, the mortality rate will be very high. Therefore, weneed further investigations and more studies to recognize the extent and thecause of renal involvement in COVID-19.

PG  - e2200031
LID - 10.1002/prca.202200031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the majority of COVID-19 patients fully recover from theinfection and become asymptomatic, a significant proportion of COVID-19 survivorsexperience a broad spectrum of symptoms lasting weeks to months post-infection, aphenomenon termed "post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)". The aim of this studyis to determine whether inflammatory proteins are dysregulated and can serve aspotential biomarkers for systemic inflammation in COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: Wedetermined the levels of inflammatory proteins in plasma from 22 COVID-19 longhaulers (COV-LH), 22 COVID-19 asymptomatic survivors (COV-AS), and 22 healthysubjects (HS) using an Olink proteomics assay and assessed the results by abeads-based multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS: Compared to HS, we found thatCOVID-19 survivors still exhibited systemic inflammation, as evidenced bysignificant changes in the levels of multiple inflammatory proteins in plasmafrom both COV-LH and COV-AS. CXCL10 was the only protein that significantlyupregulated in COV-LH compared with COV-AS and HS. CONCLUSIONS: Our resultsindicate that several inflammatory proteins remain aberrantly dysregulated inCOVID-19 survivors and CXCL10 might serve as a potential biomarker to typifyCOV-LH. Further characterization of these signature inflammatory molecules might improve the understanding of the long-term impacts of COVID-19 and provide newtargets for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 survivors with PASC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread respiratory infections with high morbidity rates caused byrespiratory viruses represent a significant global public health problem. Ourobjective was to describe cases and deaths from severe acute respiratoryinfection (SARI) in Brazil over the past 8 y as well as changes in thedistribution and risk of illness and death from SARI before and in the first yearof the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (FYP). METHODS: We performed a descriptive epidemiological study of hospitalized SARI cases and deaths between2013 and 2020 in Brazil, separated into pre-pandemic (2013 to 2019) and FYP(2020). We estimate the increase in SARI cases and deaths in the FYP as well asthe mortality and infection risks attributable to the FYP (MRAP and IRAP,respectively). RESULTS: In 2020, an excess of 425 054 cases and 109 682 deathswas observed, with a significant increase in the risk of falling ill and dyingfrom SARI, with an IRAP of 200.06 and an MRAP of 51.68 cases per 100 000inhabitants. The increase in SARI cases and deaths was particularly prominentamong patients with COVID-19, the elderly, males, those self-identifying as mixedrace and patients with heart disease and diabetes. We conclude that an important increase in morbidity and mortality due to SARI was observed in the FYP. Morevulnerable groups and those living in the Southeast, North and Center-Westregions of the country suffered the most.

TI  - Platinum-Decorated Gold Nanoparticle-Based Microfluidic Chip Immunoassay forUltrasensitive Colorimetric Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein.
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c00600 [doi]
AB  - Gold nanoparticle-based point-of-care tests (POCT) are one of the most widelyused diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the limitation of their insufficient sensitivity often leads to false negative results in early diseasediagnostics. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 makes diagnostic tools that aremore accurate, sensitive, simple, and affordable in high demand. In this work, wedevelop a platinum-decorated gold nanoparticle (Au@Pt NP)-based microfluidic chipimmunoassay with a sensitivity surpassing that of paper-based detection ofnucleocapsid (N) protein, one of the most conserved biomarkers of COVID-19. Thesynthesized Au@Pt NPs show high stability and catalytic activity in complexenvironments. The catalytic amplification of Au@Pt NPs enables naked-eyedetection of N protein in the low femtogram range (ca. 0.1 pg/mL) and thedetection of throat swab samples in under 40 min. This microfluidic chipimmunoassay is easy for operation and readout without instrument assistance,making it more suitable for on-site detection and future pathogen surveillance.

LID - ciac636 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, crowded and unsanitary livingconditions lacking medical expertise made U.S. detention centers hotbeds forinfectious disease outbreaks. There have been 30,000 COVID-19 cases, positivityrates exceeding 50%, and nine deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)custody, but the extent of disease among children under the care of the Office ofRefugee Resettlement (ORR) has not been well-documented. We sought to evaluatethe burden of COVID-19 among unaccompanied minors under the ORR's responsibility.METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 testing results of refugees and asylum seekers infacilities associated with the ORR from 02/01/2020 to 11/18/2020, courtesy of aFreedom of Information Act request. RESULTS: ORR facilities performed 7,132SARS-CoV-2 tests from 3/13/2020 to 11/18/2020. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 positivityrate was 13.4%. Factors associated with higher positivity rates were age group(16 to 17 years old); identifying as male; undergoing testing in April, August,or September; staying in a for-profit versus a non-profit facility, and detentionin certain facilities. The mean detention time with a positive test was 14.8 +/- 3.2 days. Greater than 10 percent of positive tests were in long-term detainees. CONCLUSIONS: The high SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate raises concerns about aninability to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within detention facilities housingunaccompanied migrant children, particularly those run by for-profit companies.Mandated measures for social distancing and vaccination among detainees anddetention facility employees are needed to limit the spread of the virus.

LID - 10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01155 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health challenge because of theemergence of distinct variants. Omicron, a new variant, is recognized as avariant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) because of itshigher mutations and accelerated human infection. The infection rate is strongly dependent on the binding rate of the receptor binding domain (RBD) against human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2(human)) receptor. Inhibition ofprotein-protein (RBDs((SARS-CoV-2/omicron))-ACE2(human)) interaction has beenalready proven to inhibit viral infection. We have systematically designedACE2(human)-derived peptides and peptide mimetics that have high binding affinitytoward RBD(omicron). Our peptide mutational analysis indicated the influence ofcanonical amino acids on the peptide binding process. Herein, efforts have beenmade to explore the atomistic details and events ofRBDs((SARS-CoV-2/omicron))-ACE2(human) interactions by using molecular dynamicssimulation. Our studies pave a path for developing therapeutic peptidomimeticsagainst omicron.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchers to rapidly understand thecapabilities of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and investigate potential therapeutics forSARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 has been associated with devastating lung andcardiac injury, profound inflammation, and a heightened coagulopathic state,which may, in part, be driven by cellular crosstalk facilitated by extracellular vesicles (EVs). In recent years, EVs have emerged as important biomarkers ofdisease, and while extracellular vesicles may contribute to the spread ofCOVID-19 infection from one cell to the next, they also may be engineered to playa protective or therapeutic role as decoys or "delivery drivers" for therapeutic agents. This review explores these roles and areas for future study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Planning regulations have been used to prevent theover-proliferation of hot food takeaways, minimising the impact of localobesogenic environments. To help mitigate the effects of lockdown, the UKgovernment introduced temporary changes in March 2020 to Planning Regulations forEngland, allowing food retailers to open for takeaway services beyond 'ancillary'level without needing to apply for planning permission through permitteddevelopment rights (PDR). Businesses are required to notify their local authority(LA) when they implement PDRs. To better understand the impact of regulations on the policy and practice of key professional groups, Public Health Englandcommissioned Teesside University to undertake scoping research in the North East of England. METHODS: A focus group and interviews were conducted with 15professionals from 7 of 12 North East LAs. Professions included Planners, Public Health Leads, Environmental Health Officers and Town Centre Managers. Data wereanalysed using a codebook thematic analysis approach. An interpretation meetingwith some participants was conducted. RESULTS: LAs were not aware of mostbusinesses notifying them of new regulation adherence despite taking up PDRs, butwere considered low-priority with many lacking formal recording procedures. Therewere concerns about health consequences of the changes, and consensus relating toongoing issues with capacity across all professional groups, largely due to thecontinuing pandemic and absence of a strategy out of temporary measures. Concernsexisted around ensuring cessation of restaurants trading as takeaways, andhygiene inspections backlog. Many (personally) saw new takeaways as a lifeline,offering broader menus and preserving local economies. CONCLUSION: Lack ofinformation around the number of restaurants/pubs using PDR to trade as takeaway services, ongoing capacity issues of LAs and, at the time, the absence of astrategy post regulation changes, meant there were high levels of uncertaintyregarding the impacts of these temporary measures.

TI  - First report of auxiliary liver transplantation for severe cholangiopathy afterSARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection.
LID - 10.1111/ajt.17165 [doi]
AB  - Post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cholangiopathy (PCC) is a new entityobserved in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Most patientsrecover with cholestasis improving over a period of time. In some patientscholestasis is severe and persists or progresses to liver failure necessitatingliver transplant. We present a previously healthy 50-year-old man who developedPCC with peak total bilirubin of 42.4 mg/dL and did not improve with medicalmanagement. He underwent living donor auxiliary right lobe liver transplantation.He recovered well after transplant and remains asymptomatic at 6 months follow-upwith good graft function and recovering function in native liver remnant.

PG  - 168-173
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000604 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2(SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic, with people with other conditionsat greater risk of severe infection with intensified symptoms across multipleorgan systems. Patients with cancer are at greater risk, and it is likely thatthose receiving treatment will experience greater incidence and severity ofgastrointestinal toxicities, such as gastrointestinal mucositis, due toSARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 in the intestine.RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 patients experiencegastrointestinal toxicities, and SARS-CoV-2 has capacity to infect intestinalcells through binding to ACE2 expressed in the intestine. ACE2 has a key role in intestinal homeostasis, and as such there is a concern for the impact ofSARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 in terms of the implications for cancertreatment-induced gastrointestinal toxicities. SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 is a high-riskinfection for cancer patients receiving treatment. It is important to understand the mechanisms of intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 to determine the effect ofSARS-CoV-2 infections on gastrointestinal toxicities, such as mucositis.

TI  - Healthcare provider experiences during COVID-19 redeployment.
PG  - 144-150
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000609 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Among the myriad traumatic impacts of COVID-19, the need forredeployment served as a significant stressor for healthcare providers (HCPs).This narrative review summarizes the current literature on HCP redeploymentexperiences and institutional support for staff, while proposing a theoreticalapproach to mitigating the negative impact on HCP mental health. RECENT FINDINGS:Redeployment was a strong predictor of negative emotions in HCP during theinitial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas reflections on benefit-findingassociated with redeployment were reported more frequently during later stages.In institutions where attention to redeployment impact was addressed andeffective strategies put in place, redeployed HCP felt they received adequatetraining and support and felt satisfied with the information provided.Redeployment had the potential to yield personal feelings of accomplishment,situational leadership, meaning, and increased sense of team connectedness.SUMMARY: Benefit-finding, or posttraumatic growth, is a concept in cancerpsychiatry which speaks to construing benefits from adversity to supportresilience. Redeployment experiences can result in unexpected benefit-finding forindividual HCPs. Taking a benefit-finding, relational, and existentially informedapproach to COVID-19 redeployment might serve as an opportunity for posttraumaticgrowth for both individuals and institutions.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current literature on the psychologicalimpact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer, both in terms of the impact of thevirus itself and of changes in the healthcare system; and to describe currentrecommendations for supporting patients with cancer during the pandemic. RECENTFINDINGS: Multiple studies have shown that patients with cancer experience highlevels of psychological distress during COVID-19. Factors of greatervulnerability have been described as: being young, being female, lowsocioeconomic status, lower educational level, having low levels of hope oroptimism, lower social support, and having cancer with curative intent. Thesevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2pandemic has accelerated thehealthcare digitization process. All departments involved in the diagnosis andtreatment of cancer have made contingency plans to minimize the impact onpatients. SUMMARY: Psychological distress is one of the most frequently occurringsymptoms in patients with cancer during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic hasled to a restructuring of the healthcare system. The paradigm shift may pose achallenge for both healthcare professionals and patients.

PG  - 117-122
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000605 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic posed several challenges to cancerresearch including halting of trials, reduced recruitment and protocol violationsrelated to inflexible processes followed in clinical trials. Researchers adopted innovative measures to mitigate these problems and continue studies withoutcompromising their quality. This review collates these adaptations that couldwell continue after the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic forcedresearchers globally to adopt innovative measures to overcome the challenges ofthe pandemic. These included protocol amendments to adjust to the pandemic andtravel restrictions, and increased use of digital technologies. 'Virtual'clinical trials were conducted increasingly with adaptations in ethics andregulatory approvals, patient recruitment and consenting, study interventions anddelivery of study medications, trial assessments, and monitoring. Many of theseadaptations are safe and feasible, without compromising study quality and dataintegrity. Although these may not be universally applicable in all types ofresearch, they bring many benefits including more diverse patient participation, less burden on patients for study procedures and reduced resources to conducttrials. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected cancer research adversely;however, learnings from the pandemic and adaptations from researchers are likely to improve the efficiency of clinical research beyond the pandemic.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has hadshort-term and long-term effects on the delivery of cancer care. Some Europeancountries faced an unprecedented widespread crisis during the first year of theSARS-CoV-2 pandemic, only being able afterwards to gradually recover, thanks tothe improvement in preventive measures, changes in public health and reactiveprocesses in cancer care and a better understanding of the ongoing heathemergency. RECENT FINDINGS: The development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and COVID-19specific treatments, the growing testing and tracking capability to limit virusdiffusion, and research efforts to better define areas of action have all greatlylimited the negative impact of the health emergency on routine cancer care.Theneed to protect those more vulnerable and to ensure continuity of care foroncology patients has been balanced across the pandemic, with the aim toguarantee an optimal standard of care. SUMMARY: This article aims to provide anoverview on the evolving scenario of cancer care throughout the COVID-19 pandemicin Europe, focusing on the particular features that characterized the pandemiccourse as well as the main differences that were observed across it.

TI  - Palliative care delivery changes during COVID-19 and enduring implications inoncology nursing: a rapid review.
PG  - 94-101
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000603 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A rapid review was conducted to synthesize evidence ofpalliative care delivery changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes weresynthesized according to the eight domains of high-quality palliative care andenduring implications for oncology nurses beyond the pandemic discussed. RECENTFINDINGS: The most significant changes occurred in the structure and processes ofpalliative care (Domain 1), where increased utilization of telehealth wascritical in circumventing barriers imposed by COVID-19 mitigation. The suboptimalavailability of community-based psychosocial supports for patients and caregiversand inadequate health system-based psychosocial supports for healthcare providerswere highlighted (Domains 3-5). The pandemic also ushered in an increasedemphasis on the need for advance care planning (ACP), where integrating itsdelivery earlier in the outpatient setting and shifting policy to promotesubsequent virtual documentation (Domain 8) were essential to ensure carepreferences were clarified and accessible before health crises occurred. SUMMARY:Continuing to embrace and sustain systems-level changes with respect totelehealth, psychosocial supports, and ACP are critical to bridging gaps inpalliative care delivery underscored by the pandemic. Oncology nurses are wellpositioned to fill these gaps in care beyond the pandemic by providingevidence-based, palliative care throughout the cancer continuum.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The association of kidney disease and COVID-19 vaccination has beenreported with minimal change disease being a common presentation. CASE REPORT:Index patient is a 54-year-old female who presented with a history of reductionin urine output within 3 weeks of receiving the Oxford-AztraZeneca COVID-19vaccine. Her serum creatinine on admission was 1,057 micromol/L with a premorbid serum creatinine of 78 micromol/L. Her vital signs were stable. She was onantihypertensive and antidiabetic medications for hypertension and diabetesmellitus, respectively. Renal biopsy was precluded by her morbid obesity and she was commenced on oral prednisolone. She had 5 sessions of hemodialysis and herserum creatinine gradually reduced to 106 micromol/L, and she is being followedup on an outpatient basis. CONCLUSION: We report a case of a female patient with acute kidney injury following COVID-19 Oxford-AztraZeneca vaccination. Furtherstudies are required to better understand the pathogenesis of the renalaffectation post-vaccination.

TI  - Assembling care: How nurses organise care in uncharted territory and in times of pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/1467-9566.13508 [doi]
AB  - This article draws on ethnographic research to conceptualise how nurses mobilise assemblages of caring to organise and deliver COVID care; particularly so byreorganising organisational infrastructures and practices of safe and good care. Based on participatory observations, interviews and nurse diaries, all collected during the early phase of the pandemic, the research shows how the organisingwork of nurses unfolds at different health-care layers: in the daily care forpatients and their families, in the coordination of care in and betweenhospitals, and at the level of the health-care system. These findings contrastwith the dominant pandemic-image of nurses as 'heroes at the bedside', whichfosters the classic and microlevel view of nursing and leaves the broadercontribution of nurses to the pandemic unaddressed. Theoretically, the study addsto the literature on translational mobilisation and assemblage theory byfocussing on the layered and often invisible organising work of nurses in health care.

TI  - Trends in all-cause mortality and inpatient and outpatient visits for ambulatory care sensitive conditions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: Apopulation-based study.
LID - 10.1002/jhm.12920 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of ambulatorycare sensitive conditions (ACSCs) remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compareobserved and expected (projected based on previous years) trends in all-causemortality and healthcare use for ACSCs in the first year of the pandemic (March2020 to March 2021). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted apopulation-based study using provincial health administrative data on generaladul population (Ontario, Canada). OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Monthly all-causemortality, and hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) and outpatient visitrates (per 100,000 people at-risk) for seven combined ACSCs (asthma, chronicobstructive pulmonary disease, angina, congestive heart failure, hypertension,diabetes, and epilepsy) during the first year were compared with similar periods in previous years (2016-2019) by fitting monthly time series autoregressiveintegrated moving-average models. RESULTS: Compared to previous years, all-cause mortality rates increased at the beginning of the pandemic (observed rate inMarch to May 2020 of 79.98 vs. projected of 71.24 [66.35-76.50]) and thenreturned to expected in June 2020-except among immigrants and people with mental health conditions where they remained elevated. Hospitalization and ED visitrates for ACSCs remained lower than projected throughout the first year: observedhospitalization rate of 37.29 versus projected of 52.07 (47.84-56.68); observedED visit rate of 92.55 versus projected of 134.72 (124.89-145.33). ACSCoutpatient visit rates decreased initially (observed rate of 4299.57 vs.projected of 5060.23 [4712.64-5433.46]) and then returned to expected in June2020.

TI  - Programmatic adaptations to acute malnutrition screening and treatment during theCOVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - e13406
LID - 10.1111/mcn.13406 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic presented numerous challenges to acute malnutritionscreening and treatment. To enable continued case identification and servicedelivery while minimising transmission risks, many organisations and governments implemented adaptations to community-based management of acute malnutrition(CMAM) programmes for children under 5. These included: Family mid-upper armcircumference (MUAC); modified admission and discharge criteria; modified dosage of therapeutic foods; and reduced frequency of follow-up visits. This paperpresents qualitative findings from a larger mixed methods study to documentpractitioners' operational experiences and lessons learned from theseadaptations. Findings reflect insights from 37 interviews representing 15organisations in 17 countries, conducted between July 2020 and January 2021.Overall, interviewees indicated that adaptations were mostly well-accepted bystaff, caregivers and communities. Family MUAC filled screening gaps linked toCOVID-19 disruptions; however, challenges included long-term accuracy ofcaregiver measurements; implementing an intervention that could increase demandfor inconsistent services; and limited guidance to monitor programme quality and impact. Modified admission and discharge criteria and modified dosage streamlinedlogistics and implementation with positive impacts on staff workload andcaregiver understanding of the programme. Reduced frequency of visits enabledsocial distancing by minimising crowding at facilities and lessened caregivers'need to travel. Concerns remained about how adaptations impacted children'sidentification for and progress through treatment and programme outcomes. Mostrespondents anticipated reverting to standard protocols once transmission riskswere mitigated. Further evidence, including multi-year programmatic data analysisand rigorous research, is needed in diverse contexts to understand adaptations'impacts, including how to ensure equity and mitigate unintended consequences.

AB  - This study focuses on the role of primary care in China's response to COVID-19. Aretrospective, reflective approach was taken using data available to one of theauthors who led the national community response to COVID-19, first in Wuhan andthen multiple cities in ten provinces/municipalities across the country. At thepeak of the pandemic, primary care providers shoulder various public healthresponsibilities and work in close partnerships with other key stakeholders inthe local communities. Primary care providers keep playing a'sentinel'/surveillance role in identifying re-emerging cases after theelimination of community transmissions of COVID-19. Critically, however, thepandemic once again highlights some key limitations of the primary care sector,including the lack of gatekeeping, limited capacity and weak integration between medical care and public health.

TI  - Porterville Alternate Care Site Provision of Oxygen at Covid Pandemic Peak.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.172 [doi]
AB  - During the Covid pandemic peak, the author deployed twice to an emergencyAlternate Care Site in Porterville, California. The provision of oxygen topatients there, as seen from a physician perspective, does not fully support the description in a recently published article of how the State of Californiaapproached oxygen logistics during the Covid-19 surge. In order to inform future planning, an adequate logistical assessment must include not only approaches for solving technical resource challenges, but also reliable numbers regardingend-user resource utilization and non-utilization, as well as program costs,benefits, and unintended consequences.

TI  - Cardiac Troponin Testing as a Component of Return to Play Cardiac Screening inYoung Competitive Athletes Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection.
PG  - e025369
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.025369 [doi]
AB  - Background Initial protocols for return to play cardiac testing in youngcompetitive athletes following SARS-CoV-2 infection recommended cardiac troponin (cTn) to screen for cardiac involvement. This study aimed to define thediagnostic yield of cTn in athletes undergoing cardiovascular testing followingSARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods and Results This prospective, observational cohort study from ORCCA (Outcomes Registry for Cardiac Conditions in Athletes) included collegiate athletes who underwent cTn testing as a component of return to playprotocols following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cTn values were stratified asundetectable, detectable but within normal limits, and abnormal (>99%percentile). The presence of probable or definite SARS-CoV-2 myocardialinvolvement was compared between those with normal versus abnormal cTn levels. A total of 3184/3685 (86%) athletes in the ORCCA database met the inclusioncriteria for this study (age 20+/-1 years, 32% female athletes, 28% Black race). The median time from SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis to cTn testing was 13 days(interquartile range, 11, 18 days). The cTn levels were undetectable in 2942athletes (92%), detectable but within normal limits in 210 athletes (7%), andabnormal in 32 athletes (1%). Of the 32 athletes with abnormal cTn testing, 19/32(59%) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 30/32 (94%) underwenttransthoracic echocardiography, and 1/32 (3%) did not have cardiac imaging. Oneathlete with abnormal troponin met the criteria for definite or probableSARS-CoV-2 myocardial involvement. In the total cohort, 21/3184 (0.7%) hadSARS-CoV-2 myocardial involvement, among whom 20/21 (95%) had normal troponintesting. Conclusions Abnormal cTn during routine return to play cardiac screeningamong competitive athletes following SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to have limiteddiagnostic utility.

AB  - Following the report of an excess in paediatric cases of severe acute hepatitisof unknown aetiology by the United Kingdom (UK) on 5 April 2022, 427 cases werereported from 20 countries in the World Health Organization European Region tothe European Surveillance System TESSy from 1 January 2022 to 16 June 2022. Here,we analysed demographic, epidemiological, clinical and microbiological dataavailable in TESSy. Of the reported cases, 77.3% were 5 years or younger and53.5% had a positive test for adenovirus, 10.4% had a positive RT-PCR forSARS-CoV-2 and 10.3% were coinfected with both pathogens. Cases with adenovirusinfections were significantly more likely to be admitted to intensive care orhigh-dependency units (OR=2.11; 95% CI: 1.18-3.74) and transplanted (OR=3.36; 95%CI: 1.19-9.55) than cases with a negative test result for adenovirus, but thiswas no longer observed when looking at this association separately between the UKand other countries. Aetiological studies are needed to ascertain if adenovirusplays a role in this possible emergence of hepatitis cases in children and, ifconfirmed, the mechanisms that could be involved.

LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.31.2200039 [doi]
AB  - In the Netherlands, the avian influenza outbreak in poultry in 2003 and the Qfever outbreak in dairy goats between 2007 and 2010 had severe consequences forpublic health. These outbreaks led to the establishment of an integratedhuman-veterinary risk analysis system for zoonoses, the Zoonoses Structure. Theaim of the Zoonoses Structure is to signal, assess and control emerging zoonoses that may pose a risk to animal and/or human health in an integrated One Healthapproach. The Signalling Forum Zoonoses (SO-Z), the first step of the ZoonosesStructure, is a multidisciplinary committee composed of experts from the medical,veterinary, entomology and wildlife domains. The SO-Z shares relevant signalswith professionals and has monthly meetings. Over the past 10 years (June 2011 toDecember 2021), 390 different signals of various zoonotic pathogens in animalreservoirs and humans have been assessed. Here, we describe the ZoonosesStructure with examples from signals and responses for four zoonotic events inthe Netherlands (tularaemia, Brucella canis, West Nile virus, and severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)). This may serve as an examplefor other countries on how to collaborate in a One Health approach to signal and control emerging zoonoses.

LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.31.2200561 [doi]
AB  - Functional immunity (defined here as serum neutralising capacity) criticallycontributes to conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severeCOVID-19. This cross-sectional analysis of a prospective, population-based cohortstudy included 1,894 randomly-selected 16 to 99-year-old participants from twoSwiss cantons in March 2022. Of these, 97.6% (95% CI: 96.8-98.2%) had anti-spike IgG antibodies, and neutralising capacity was respectively observed for 94%, 92% and 88% against wild-type SARS-CoV-2, Delta and Omicron variants. Studyingfunctional immunity to inform and monitor vaccination campaigns is crucial.

AB  - Small molecule therapeutic agents are needed to treat or prevent infections bysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. To expedite the discovery of lead compounds fordevelopment, assays have been developed based on affinity selection-massspectrometry (AS-MS), which enables the rapid screening of mixtures such ascombinatorial libraries and extracts of botanicals or other sources of naturalproducts. AS-MS assays have been used to find ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spikeprotein for inhibition of cell entry as well as to the 3-chymotrypsin-likecysteine protease (3CLpro) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complexconstituent Nsp9, which are targets for inhibition of viral replication. TheAS-MS approach of magnetic microbead affinity selection screening has been usedto discover high-affinity peptide ligands to the spike protein as well as thehemp cannabinoids cannabidiolic acid and cannabigerolic acid, which can preventcell infection by SARS-CoV-2. Another AS-MS method, native mass spectrometry, hasbeen used to discover that the flavonoids baicalein, scutellarein, andganhuangenin, can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro. Native massspectrometry has also been used to find an ent-kaurane natural product, oridonin,that can bind to the viral protein Nsp9 and interfere with RNA replication. Thesenatural lead compounds are under investigation for the development of therapeuticagents to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - The relationship to the face: from the normal subject to the Alzheimer patient,from the naked face to the masked face, from a humanistic neuropsychology to anembodied ethics
PG  - 219-233
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1038 [doi]
AB  - The relationship to the face weaves close links with identity and otherness. Itis not just a means of inter-human knowledge; it is also a major means ofself/other communication underpinned by those mentalization networks that open upthe attribution of intentions and emotions to others (theory of mind) as well as that particular disposition known as empathy, which enables us to put ourselvesin another person's shoes by feeling and understanding what they are experiencingwhile remaining ourselves. Neuropsychology attempts to shed light on the brainprocesses that underlie this encounter with the face and that may be altered byneurodegenerative diseases, and in particular by Alzheimer's disease. Thepandemic period also leads us to examine the clinical consequences of wearing amask both in normal subjects and in subjects suffering from diseases that affect the relationship with the face of others. A humanistic neuropsychology mustintegrate an embodied ethics that attempts to discern what, in the perception of the Other, contributes to hindering the expression of otherness, which isinseparable from the human condition. In the pandemic context linked to Covid-19,neuropsychology with its clinical requirements and ethics with its performativeaim on care practices, can thus cross-fertilize each other to propose compromisesthat are certainly attentive to public health but also to the well-being of each human being, especially the most vulnerable.

TI  - The immediate impact of Covid-19 infection and the resulting lockdown on nursing home residents
PG  - 173-181
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1034 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Following the Covid-19 epidemic affecting 76 of the 97 residents(78.3 %) in a French nursing home, we assessed the impact of this cluster period on the physical and psycho-cognitive health of the residents, expecting inparticular to observe effects that were dependent on their state ofcognitive-behavioural dependence. Methods: We retained twenty-two variables, 5relating to demographic data, 6 to the specific care linked to Covid-19infection, 6 to somatic pathologies and psycho-behavioural disturbances beforethe epidemic and 5 to the period following it. Results: Eleven residents amongthose diagnosed positive died. Nine were transferred to a Covid unit, and 35 wereasymptomatic. The main consequences of the period of infections were inparticular behavioural, nutritional, and motor. A history of disruptivebehaviours before the appearance of the cluster increased the risk of anaggravation of these behaviours by four (RR = 3.9, IC95 % = 1.38-11.02, p =0.0042). Twenty per cent of the residents presented under-nutrition at the end oflockdown, but no specific risk factors could be identified. However, states ofunder-nutrition for the whole of 2020 were significantly more frequent than in2019, in particular severe cases (chi(2) = 5.43, p = 0.02). A history ofunder-nutrition in the previous year increased twofold the likelihood ofunder-nutrition in the following year (RR = 2.07, IC95 % = 1.14-3.74, p = 0.02). The Covid cluster period also had an effect on the functional autonomy of certainpatients. Conclusion: Our main hypothesis relating to cognitive-behaviouraldependence was not completely validated. The impact of the occurrence of thecluster remained moderate, in particular because of the care resources affordedby the nursing home. The advantages of a "medicalised" facility, and the problemsassociated with the restrictions of lockdown, are viewed in the light of ethical considerations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection and the resulting coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) have spread allaround the world since 2019 and have affected millions of people. The developmentof COVID-19 vaccines helped to decelerate the spread of the virus. However, as inthe case of vaccines against other infectious diseases, adverse events can alsopresent with COVID-19 vaccines. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a rare case of a 53-year-old man with knee-joint synovitis, after the first dose of messengerRNA vaccine, with no fever and a negative COVID-19 reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test. During a clinical examination the suspicion ofpyogenic arthritis was excluded by blood tests and by a complex joint effusionexamination, including a microbiological and cytological-energy analysis of thesynovial fluid. The treatment received by our patient consisted of 3 doses ofdexamethasone administered intravenously over a period of 3 days. All thesymptoms improved after this therapy, and in the 3-week follow-up period werecorded full recovery with no consequences. CONCLUSION: Case reports on patientsundergoing COVID-19 vaccination should be examined in order to detect rare andlong-term side-effects. This is the first report to present the outcomes of anultrastructural analysis of post-vaccination synovitis.

TI  - PUBLIC PERCEPTION ABOUT PANDEMIC SITUATION AND PREPAREDNESS TOWARDS A PROBABLELOCKDOWN IN AN AFFECTED INDIAN STATE AMIDST THE SECOND WAVE OF THE COVID-19PANDEMIC.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.190 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 second wave badly affected India. This study assessedpublic preparedness and attitude towards a new lockdown in the state of WestBengal (WB) along with perception about the COVID pandemic situation. METHODS: Ananonymous questionnaire was administered to all willing adult attendees of aCOVID vaccination centre in Kolkata, capital city of WB. Logistic regression was applied to find the relationship between attitude towards lockdown and otherselected independent variables. RESULTS: Of 839 persons analysed, 72.0% werenon-health workers; 55.4% thought that available vaccines reduce COVID-19 risk.Among them, 54.4% wanted stricter guidelines for imposition. For preparedness,42.6% and 28.8% said they would stock additional food and medicines respectively.On multiple logistic regression, being female, having elderly family members,perceiving the second wave as worse and favouring stricter restrictions all hadodds of favourable attitude towards the new, proposed lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Anew lockdown was favoured by the majority. However, a well-planned and phasedapproach for this is needed in the light of many concerns about the previouslockdown. Mental health issues, financial security, medical help at hand and easeof travel to workplace are important issues that need to be addressed in case of future lockdown(s).

TI  - Depressive Symptoms in Mothers With Infants: The Quantitative Evidence of theAssociation of COVID-19 Crisis-Related Factors in Japan.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.167 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores the depressive symptoms in postpartum women duringthe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Japan. METHODS: An onlinesurvey conducted from May 31 to June 6, 2020 resulted in 3073 responses obtained from mothers with infants < 12 mo. RESULTS: The point prevalence of the EdinburghPostnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of >/= 9 was 28.66% for primipara and25.83% for multipara. Logistic regression analysis indicated a negativeassociation between the COVID-19 crisis and EPDS >/= 9; specifically, decreasedsocial support and financial concern were identified as risk factors. TheCOVID-19-related experiences significantly increased the score of each factor of EPDS, ie, anxiety, anhedonia, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19crisis, the number of mothers who faced depreciation in social support and incomehad increased. Moreover, spending their perinatal period during the crisisincreased the propensity of facing unexpected changes, such as changes ofhospitals for delivery, or cancellation of parenting classes. These multiplefactors were associated with an elevated risk of depression in postpartum women. In a prolonged crisis, postpartum mental health should be treated carefully with the prevention of infection.

TI  - CAMPAIGN DISASTER RESPONSE - WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.202 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has seen health systems adapt and change in response tolocal and international experiences. This paper describes the experiences andlearnings by the Central Adelaide Local Health Network (CALHN) in managing acampaign style, novel public health disaster response. BACKGROUND: Disasterpreparedness has focussed on acute impact, mass casualty incidents. In early 2020CALHNs largest hospital the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) was appointed as thestate primary COVID-19 adult receiving hospital. Between the period of 1(st)February 2020 when the first COVID-19 positive patient was admitted, through to31(st) December 2020 the RAH had admitted 146 inpatients with COVID-19, 118admitted to our hospital in the home service, 18 patients admitted to IntensiveCare and four patients died whilst inpatients. During this time CALHN hassustained an active (physical and virtual) Network Incident Command Centre (NICC)supported by a Network Incident Management Team (NIMT). RESULTS: This paperdescribes our key lessons learnt in relation to the management of a campaignstyle disaster response including the importance of disaster preparedness,fatigue management and communication. Also described were the challenges ofoperating in a command model and the role of exercising and education and anoverview of our operating rhythm, how we built capability and lessons management.CONCLUSION: Undertaking a longer duration disaster response, relating to theCOVID-19 pandemic has shown that whilst traditional disaster principles still areimportant there are many nuances that need to be considered to retain aproportionate response. Our key lessons have revolved around the key tenants ofdisaster management, communication, capability, and governance.

TI  - COVID-19 during the index hospital admission confers a 'double-hit' effect on hipfracture patients and is associated with a two-fold increase in 1-year mortality risk.
LID - 10.1002/msc.1674 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aims were to: (1) determine 1-year mortality rates for hip fracture patients during the first UK COVID-19 wave, and (2) assess mortality riskassociated with COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide multicentre cohort study wasconducted of all patients presenting to 17 hospitals in March-April 2020.Follow-up data were collected one year after initial hip fracture ('index')admission, including: COVID-19 status, readmissions, mortality, and cause ofdeath. RESULTS: Data were available for 788/833 (94.6%) patients. One-yearmortality was 242/788 (30.7%), and the prevalence of COVID-19 within 365 days of admission was 142/788 (18.0%). One-year mortality was higher for patients withCOVID-19 (46.5% vs. 27.2%; p < 0.001), and highest for those COVID-positiveduring index admission versus after discharge (54.7% vs. 39.7%; p = 0.025).Anytime COVID-19 was independently associated with 50% increased mortality riskwithin a year of injury (HR 1.50, p = 0.006); adjusted mortality risk doubled (HR2.03, p < 0.001) for patients COVID-positive during index admission. Noindependent association was observed between mortality risk and COVID-19diagnosed following discharge (HR 1.16, p = 0.462). Most deaths (56/66; 84.8%) inCOVID-positive patients occurred within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (median11.0 days). Most cases diagnosed following discharge from the admission hospital occurred in downstream hospitals. CONCLUSION: Almost half the patients that hadCOVID-19 within 365 days of fracture had died within one year of injury versus27.2% of COVID-negative patients. Only COVID-19 diagnosed during the indexadmission was associated independently with an increased likelihood of death,indicating that infection during this time may represent a 'double-hit' insult,and most COVID-related deaths occurred within 30 days of diagnosis.

TI  - Adaptations in Vascular Access Procedures as an Initiative to Protect Healthcare Workers Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/nhs.12974 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has led to procedural changes in vascular access services in order toprotect healthcare workers and patients from further spread of the virus.Operational changes made by the vascular access service at a healthcare system inNew York City during the first wave of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in New York City included a team-based approach as well as consideration for types oflines placed to address the increase in patient volume while providing safety to healthcare workers and conserving PPE equipment. The study consists of twosamples of adult inpatients admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC in need ofvascular access. Chi-square tests of independence were utilized to analyze trendsin data. By the fourth wave, usage of shorter life span ultrasound-guidedperipheral IVs increased significantly and the use of longer lasting intravenous catheters decreased significantly between the first and fourth waves of COVID-19.The goals of this paper are to show that with greater knowledge about proper PPE and mindful resource utilization, hospitals are able to become more comfortableand efficient while providing increasingly frequent vascular access services inthe current and future pandemics.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with epilepsy: findings from the US armof the COV-E study.
LID - 10.1002/epi4.12637 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As part of the COVID-19 and Epilepsy (COV-E) global study, we aimedto understand the impact of COVID-19 on the medical care and well-being of peoplewith epilepsy (PWE) in the United States, based on their perspectives and thoseof their caregivers. METHODS: Separate surveys designed for PWE and theircaregivers were circulated from April 2020 to July 2021; modifications in March2021 included a question about COVID-19 vaccination status. RESULTS: We received 788 responses, 71% from PWE (n = 559) and 29% (n=229) from caregivers of persons with epilepsy. A third (n = 308) of respondents reported a change in their healthor in the health of the person they care for. Twenty-seven percent (n = 210)reported issues related to worsening mental health. Of respondents taking ASMs (n= 769), 10% (n= 78) reported difficulty taking medications on time, mostly due tostress causing forgetfulness. Less than half of respondents received counselingon mental health and stress. Less than half of the PWE reported havingdiscussions with their healthcare providers about sleep, ASMs and potential side effects, while a larger proportion of caregivers (81%) reported having haddiscussions with their healthcare providers on the same topics. More PWE andcaregivers reported that COVID-19 related measures caused adverse impact on theirhealth in the post-vaccine period than during the pre-vaccine period, citingmental health issues as the primary reason. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicatethat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US on PWE is multifaceted. Apart from the increased risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes, the pandemic has also hadnegative effects on mental health and self-management. Healthcare providers must be vigilant for increased emotional distress in PWE during the pandemic andconsider the importance of effective counseling to diminish risks related toexacerbated treatment gaps.

TI  - Kihon Checklist items associated with the development of frailty and recovery to robust status during the COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/ggi.14447 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The Kihon Checklist (KCL) is used to assess frailty in daily life. We aimed to identify KCL items associated with the development of frailty and recovery to robust status during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a 1-yearprospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults aged 70 and 75 years inOtawara City, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. Information regarding age, sex, presenceof disease and KCL items was collected in May 2020 (baseline) and June 2021(follow-up) using a mailed questionnaire. Changes in frailty status as determinedby the KCL at baseline and follow-up were evaluated. To clarify factors relatedto changes in the frailty status, we conducted two sets of binomial logisticregression analyses with the presence/absence of development of frailty andpresence/absence of recovery to robust status at follow-up as the dependentvariables and the KCL items as the independent variables. RESULTS: The analysisincluded 716 participants who provided complete responses to both questionnaires.The KCL Items 6, 10, 20, 23 and 24 were related to the development of frailty,and the KCL Items 6, 15, 21 and 23 were associated with the recovery to robuststatus. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline KCL items regarding physical function andassociated mental aspects were related to both development of frailty andrecovery to robust status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cognitive and depressive declines were associated with the development of frailty, while good oralenvironment and sense of fulfillment in life were associated with the recovery torobust status.

AB  - COVID-19 both creates and complicates public health challenges. Yet the pandemic also provides a unique lens for dissecting complex issues in global health thatcould benefit society in the long run. In this paper, we discuss the underlyingreasons that can help explain the divergent COVID-19 control outcomes betweenBeijing and Shanghai-two advanced metropolitans that are similar in theirmunicipal capacity, administrative capability and pandemic strategy. We hopeinsights of this investigation contribute to the development of diseaseprevention systems, such as context-specific and data-driven public healthstrategies that could yield optimal pandemic control outcomes with minimalunintended consequences, both amid and beyond COVID-19.

TI  - The Effect of Perceived Organizational Support of Nurses on Their Resilience: ACross-Sectional Study From Turkey.
PG  - 8445621221118800
LID - 10.1177/08445621221118800 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Throughout and following the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak, there isan urgent need to focus on organizational support strategies aimed at improvingthe resilience of nurses. PURPOSE: This research aims to examine the relationshipbetween the nurses' perceived organizational support and their resilience levels,and to reveal the characteristics that make a significant difference. METHODS:The data of this descriptive and cross-sectional study were collected from 722nurses in February 2021 using the web-based survey method. The study followed theSTROBE guideline. The data collection tools included the Introductory InformationForm, the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support, and the PsychologicalResilience Scale. RESULTS: Nurses were concluded to have perceived a moderatelevel of organizational support and their psychological resilience were found to be higher than average. A positive relationship was determined between theorganizational support perceived by nurses and their psychological resilience.The gender, position/title of nurses, their work experience in COVID-19 treatmentservices, and having been infected with the COVID-19 virus were found to affecttheir perception of organizational support and resilience. CONCLUSION:Organizational support perceived by nurses significantly affects theirresilience. Resilience programs should, in particular, prioritize permanentclinical nurses who are in the risk group in terms of resilience, female nurses, nurses who had been infected with the COVID 19 virus, and nurses who have beenassigned to COVID-19 treatment wards.

LID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.34746-21.2 [doi]
AB  - It has been reported that in 25% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases,the central and peripheral nervous systems have been affected. Furthermore, thereis an established association between COVID-19 and encephalitis, which most oftenpresents with confusion and disorientation. The mortality rate of encephalitiscan be decreased by early diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a case of a71-year-old woman who was hospitalized with the symptoms of confusion and feverand was found to be COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive by bothcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab analysis. The patient underwenttranssphenoidal pituitary surgery 4 months before her admission and was in anacute confusional state accompanied with consciousness fluctuations andagitation. On magentic resonance imaging, the hyperintensities detected in the T2and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery axial sections of the bilateral temporal brain areas and paramedian region of pons were observed to be compatible withencephalitis. The nasopharyngeal and CSF severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) PCR was performed because thethorax computed tomography revealed findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumoniaand both the samples were found to be PCR-positive. Encephalitis arising fromtoxic and metabolic causes was excluded. In this case, the COVID-19-associatedencephalitis was treated with dual antiviral (favipiravir and acyclovir) andsteroid therapies. This case was considered unique as very few cases of positive nasopharyngeal and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR have been reported and because of thepatient's history of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery 4 months before herhospitalization.

TI  - A Review of Clinical Efficacy Data Supporting Emergency Use Authorization forCOVID-19 Therapeutics and Lessons for Future Pandemics.
LID - 10.1111/cts.13384 [doi]
AB  - Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) to expedite the availability of therapeutics in the context of a publichealth emergency. To date, an evidentiary standard for clinical efficacy tosupport an EUA has not yet been established. This review examines the clinicaldata submitted in support of EUA for anti-viral and anti-inflammatorytherapeutics for COVID-19 through December of 2021 and the resilience of theauthorization as new clinical data arose subsequent to the authorization. In the vast majority of cases, EUA was supported by at least one well powered randomizedcontrolled trial (RCT) where statistically significant efficacy was demonstrated.This included branded medications already approved for use outside of the contextof COVID-19. When employed, the standard of a single RCT seemed to provideadequate evidence of clinical efficacy such that subsequent clinical studiesgenerally supported or expanded the EUA of the therapeutic in question. The lone generic agent that was granted EUA (Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine) was notsupported by a well-controlled RCT, and the EUA was withdrawn within three monthstime. This highlighted not only the ambiguity of the EUA standard, but also theneed to provide avenues through which high quality clinical evidence for theefficacy of a generic medication could be obtained. Therefore, maintaining theclinical trial networks assembled during the COVID-19 pandemic could be acritical component of our preparation for future pandemics. Consideration couldalso be given to establishing a single successful RCT as regulatory guidance for obtaining an EUA.

AB  - The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known asCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) sparked a global public health pandemic that has impacted every aspect of daily life. Medical research was affected, and many clinical trials were halted to minimize COVID-19 transmission risk and spreadwhile the world navigated this novel virus. Here we describe the relaunch of our virtual reality (VR) pilot clinical trial that uses an in-lab brain and bodytraining program to promote brain health in mid-to-late life older adults, in theera of COVID-19. This case series includes five healthy female participantsbetween 51 and 76 years of age, a subset of a larger VR pilot clinical trial thatstarted pre-pandemic. We developed a revised study protocol based on the Centerfor Disease Control and World Health Organization guidelines to help manage thespread of COVID-19. Since the limited resumption of clinical trials at ourinstitution in August 2020, we successfully completed over 200 in-lab virtualreality training sessions using our revised protocol. During this time, none ofthe five participants or three study staff reported any COVID-19 symptoms orreported a positive COVID-19 test. More than 40 voluntary COVID-19 tests werecompleted by our study staff over the last 6 months. All participants rated oursafety protocol as very satisfied or extremely satisfied and that they would bevery likely or extremely likely to participate in a VR clinical trial during the pandemic. Based on these findings, we suggest that continued VR clinical trialresearch during the COVID-19 pandemic is achievable and can be safely resumed if specific safety protocols are in place to mitigate the risk of exposure andspread of COVID-19.

LID - 10.1155/2022/7493087 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of vaccines for COVID-19 has been helpful in the fight against the spread of the disease. Even with these vaccines, the virus continues to spread inmany countries, with some vaccinated persons even reported to have been infected,calling for administration of booster vaccines. The need for continued use ofnonpharmaceutical interventions to complement the administration of vaccinescannot therefore be overemphasized. This study presents a novel mathematicalmodel to study the impact of quarantine and double-dose vaccination on the spreadof the disease. The local stability analysis of the COVID-19-free and endemicequilibria is examined using the Lyapunov second technique. The equilibria arefound to be locally asymptotically stable if 0 < 1 and 0 > 1, respectively.Besides other analytical results, numerical simulations are performed toillustrate the analytical results established in the paper.

AB  - As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has put the world in an unprecedentedpredicament, thousands of people have died. Data from structured and unstructuredsources are combined to create user-friendly platforms for clinicians andresearchers in an integrated bioinformatics approach. The diagnosis and treatmentof COVID-19 disease can be accelerated using AI-based platforms. In the battleagainst the virus, however, researchers and decision-makers must contend with an ever-increasing volume of data, referred to as "big data." VGG19 and ResNet152V2 pretrained deep learning architectures were used in this study. With thesedatasets, we could train and fine-tune our model on lung ultrasound frames fromhealthy people as well as from patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia. In twoseparate experiments, we evaluated two different classes of predictive models:one against pneumonia and the other against non-COVID-19. COVID-19 can bedetected and diagnosed accurately and efficiently using these models, accordingto the findings. Therefore, the use of these inexpensive and affordable deeplearning methods should be considered as a reliable method for the diagnosis ofCOVID-19.

AB  - Due to their prevalence, respiratory diseases have attained great attention from the historical time. Furthermore, it has been explored in a new dimension due to recent viral outbreaks such as COVID-19. Even though modern medicine treats themajority of respiratory ailments, it is reported that the majority of people(>/=80 %) who suffer from respiratory disorders do not take medication for their conditions, and a considerable number of people still believe in and use herbalmedicines. Herbal therapies have been utilized all over the world for thousandsof years. Traditional herbal treatment has long been seen as a valuable practice in Saudi Arabia, long before modern medicine. Due to its location in the desertand humid climate, Saudi Arabia suffers from a high rate of respiratory illnessescaused by dust, pollens, and viruses. Several published literature have employed different plants and plant products for respiratory problems, but there has yetto be a single, complete study centered on Saudi Arabia. In this review, 41plants were identified, which has complete details regarding their usage intraditional practice for respiratory disorders. A thorough investigation wasconducted and the results were detailed.

PG  - 9929038
LID - 10.1155/2022/9929038 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) have extremely highrates of mortality. This study evaluated the prognostic impact of AKI duration onin-hospital mortality in elder patients. Methods: We performed a retrospectivestudy of 126 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with severe or critical disease whotreated in the ICU from February 4, 2020, to April 16, 2020. AKI was definedaccording to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine (Scr) criteria. AKI patients were divided into transient AKI and persistent AKI groups based on whether Scr level returned to baseline within 48 h post-AKI. Results: Intotal, 107 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 70(64-78) years, and 69 (64.5%) patients were men. AKI occurred in 48 (44.9%)during their ICU stay. Of these, 11 (22.9%) had transient AKI, and 37 (77.9%) hadpersistent AKI. In-hospital mortality was 18.6% (n = 11) for patients withoutAKI, 72.7% (n = 8) for patients with transient AKI, and 86.5% (n = 32) forpatients with persistent AKI (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealedthat patients with both transient AKI and persistent AKI had significantly higherdeath rates than those without AKI (log-rank P < 0.001). Multivariate Coxregression analysis revealed that transient and persistent AKI were an important risk factor for in-hospital mortality in older patients with severe COVID-19 evenafter adjustment for variables (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.582; 95% CI: 1.025-6.505; P= 0.044; and HR = 6.974; 95% CI: 3.334-14.588; P < 0.001). Conclusions: AKIduration can be an important predictive parameter in elder patients sufferingfrom COVID-19 and are admitted to ICU. Among these patients, those exhibitingpersistent AKI have a lower in-hospital survival rate than those with transientAKI, emphasizing the importance of identifying an appropriate treatment windowfor early intervention.

AB  - Background: Several reports suggested that acute kidney injury (AKI) is arelatively common occurrence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but itsprevalence is inconsistently reported across different populations. Moreover, it is unknown whether AKI results from a direct infection of the kidney bySARS-CoV-2 or it is a consequence of the physiologic disturbances and therapiesused to treat COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of AKI since itvaries by geographical settings, time periods, and populations studied and toinvestigate whether clinical information and laboratory findings collected athospital admission might influence AKI incidence (and mortality) in a particular point in time during hospitalization for COVID-19. Methods: Herein we conducted aprospective longitudinal study investigating the prevalence of AKI and associatedfactors in 997 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Baqiyatallah general hospital ofTehran (Iran), collecting both clinical information and several dates (of: birth;hospital admission; AKI onset; ICU admission; hospital discharge; death). Inorder to examine how the clinical factors influenced AKI incidence and all-cause mortality during hospitalization, survival analysis using the Coxproportional-hazard models was adopted. Two separate multiple Cox regressionmodels were fitted for each outcome (AKI and death). Results: In this group ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of AKI was 28.5% and the mortalityrate was 19.3%. AKI incidence was significantly enhanced by diabetes,hyperkalemia, higher levels of WBC count, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). COVID-19patients more likely to die over the course of their hospitalization were thosepresenting a joint association between ICU admission with either severe COVID-19 or even mild/moderate COVID-19, hypokalemia, and higher levels of BUN, WBC, andLDH measured at hospital admission. Diabetes and comorbidities did not increasethe mortality risk among these hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Sincethe majority of patients developed AKI after ICU referral and 40% of them wereadmitted to ICU within 2 days since hospital admission, these patients may havebeen already in critical clinical conditions at admission, despite being affectedby a mild/moderate form of COVID-19, suggesting the need of early monitoring ofthese patients for the onset of eventual systemic complications.

AB  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has lasted for over 2years now and has already caused millions of deaths. In COVID-19, leukocytepyroptosis has been previously associated with both beneficial and detrimentaleffects, so its role in the development of this disease remains controversial.Using transcriptomic data (GSE157103) of blood leukocytes from 126 acuterespiratory distress syndrome patients (ARDS) with or without COVID-19, we found that COVID-19 patients present with enhanced leukocyte pyroptosis. Based onunsupervised clustering, we divided 100 COVID-19 patients into two clusters(PYRcluster1 and PYRcluster2) according to the expression of 35pyroptosis-related genes. The results revealed distinct pyroptotic patternsassociated with different leukocytes in these PYRclusters. PYRcluster1 patientswere in a hyperinflammatory state and had a worse prognosis than PYRcluster2patients. The hyperinflammation of PYRcluster1 was validated by the results ofgene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of proteomic data (MSV000085703). Thesedifferences in pyroptosis between the two PYRclusters were confirmed by thePYRscore. To improve the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients, we used leastabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct aprognostic model based on differentially expressed genes between PYRclusters(PYRsafescore), which can be applied as an effective prognosis tool. Lastly, weexplored the upstream transcription factors of different pyroptotic patterns,thereby identifying 112 compounds with potential therapeutic value in publicdatabases.

TI  - Optimisation of anti-interleukin-6 therapy: Precision medicine throughmathematical modelling.
PG  - 919489
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.919489 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dysregulated interleukin (IL)-6 production can be characterised bythe levels present, the kinetics of its rise and its inappropriate location.Rapid, excessive IL-6 production can exacerbate tissue damage in vital organs. Inthis situation, therapy with an anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)monoclonal antibody, if inappropriately dosed, may be insufficient to fully blockIL-6 signalling and normalise the immune response. Methods: We analysedinhibition of C-reactive protein (CRP) - a biomarker for IL-6 activity - inpatients with COVID-19 or idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD)treated with tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) or siltuximab (anti-IL-6), respectively. Weused mathematical modelling to analyse how to optimise anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6Rblockade for the high levels of IL-6 observed in these diseases. Results: IL-6signalling was insufficiently inhibited in patients with COVID-19 or iMCD treatedwith standard doses of anti-IL-6 therapy. Patients whose disease worsenedthroughout therapy had only partial inhibition of CRP production. Our modeldemonstrated that, in a scenario representative of iMCD with persistent high IL-6production not controlled by a single dose of anti-IL-6 therapy, repeatedadministration more effectively inhibited IL-6 activity. In a situation withrapid, high, dysregulated IL-6 production, such as severe COVID-19 or a cytokine storm, repeated daily administration of an anti-IL-6/anti-IL-6R agent, oralternating daily doses of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R therapies, could neutraliseIL-6 activity. Conclusion: In clinical practice, IL-6 inhibition should beindividualised based on pathophysiology to achieve full blockade of CRPproduction. Funding: EUSA Pharma funded medical writing assistance and providedaccess to the phase II clinical data of siltuximab for analysis.

AB  - The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the human immune system is at the basis of thepositive or negative outcome of the infection. Monocytes and macrophages, whichare major innate immune/inflammatory effector cells, are not directly infected bySARS-CoV-2, however they can react to the virus and mount a strong reaction.Whether this first interaction and reaction may bias innate reactivity tore-challenge, a phenomenon known as innate memory, is currently unexplored andmay be part of the long-term sequelae of COVID-19. Here, we have tested thecapacity of SARS-CoV-2 and some of its proteins to induce innate memory in human monocytes in vitro. Our preliminary results show that the Spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and the entire heat-inactivated virus have no substantial effect.Conversely, monocytes pre-exposed to the nucleocapsid N protein react tosubsequent viral or bacterial challenges with an increased production ofanti-inflammatory IL-1Ra, a response profile suggesting a milder response to new infections.

AB  - Vaccines can prevent many millions of illnesses against infectious diseases andsave numerous lives every year. However, traditional vaccines such as inactivatedviral and live attenuated vaccines cannot adapt to emerging pandemics due totheir time-consuming development. With the global outbreak of the COVID-19epidemic, the virus continues to evolve and mutate, producing mutants withenhanced transmissibility and virulence; the rapid development of vaccinesagainst such emerging global pandemics becomes more and more critical. In recent years, mRNA vaccines have been of significant interest in combating emerginginfectious diseases due to their rapid development and large-scale productionadvantages. However, their development still suffers from many hurdles such astheir safety, cellular delivery, uptake, and response to their manufacturing,logistics, and storage. More efforts are still required to optimize the moleculardesigns of mRNA molecules with increased protein expression and enhancedstructural stability. In addition, a variety of delivery systems are also needed to achieve effective delivery of vaccines. In this review, we highlight theadvances in mRNA vaccines against various infectious diseases and discuss themolecular design principles and delivery systems of associated mRNA vaccines. Thecurrent state of the clinical application of mRNA vaccine pipelines againstvarious infectious diseases and the challenge, safety, and protective effect ofassociated vaccines are also discussed.

AB  - Background and Methods: The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is the antigenically most distinctvariant to date. As the heavily mutated spike protein enables neutralizationescape, we studied serum-neutralizing activities of naive and vaccinatedindividuals after Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 sub-lineage infections in live virusneutralization tests with Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2, wildtype (WT, B1.1), andDelta (B.1.617.2) strains. Serum samples obtained after WT infections andthree-dose mRNA vaccinations with and without prior infection were included ascontrols. Results: Primary BA.1 infections yielded reduced neutralizing antibody levels against WT, Delta, and Omicron BA.2, while samples from BA.2-infectedindividuals showed almost no cross-neutralization against the other variants.Serum neutralization of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants was detectable afterthree-dose mRNA vaccinations, but with reduced titers. Vaccination-breakthroughinfections with either Omicron BA.1 or BA.2, however, generated equalcross-neutralizing antibody levels against all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that although Omicron variants are able toenhance cross-neutralizing antibody levels in pre-immune individuals, primaryinfections with BA.1 or BA.2 induced mostly variant-specific neutralizingantibodies, emphasizing the differently shaped humoral immunity induced by thetwo Omicron variants. These data thus contribute substantially to theunderstanding of antibody responses induced by primary Omicron infections ormultiple exposures to different SARS-CoV-2 variants and are of particularimportance for developing vaccination strategies in the light of future emerging variants.

AB  - Background: While repeated shutdown and lockdown measures helped contain thespread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing andself-isolation negatively impacted global mental health in 2020 and 2021.Although suicide rates did reportedly not increase during the first months of thepandemic, long-term data, and data on the quality of serious violent suicideattempts (SVSAs) are not available to date. Materials and methods: Orthopaedictrauma patient visits to the emergency department (ED), ED trauma teamactivations, and SVSAs were retrospectively evaluated from January 2019 until May2021 in four Level-I Trauma Centers in Berlin, Germany. SVSAs were assessed forsuicide method, injury pattern and severity, type of treatment, and length ofhospital stay. Results: Significantly fewer orthopaedic trauma patients presentedto EDs during the pandemic (n = 70,271) compared to the control (n = 84,864)period (p = 0.0017). ED trauma team activation numbers remained unchanged. SVSAs (corrected for seasonality) also remained unchanged during control (n = 138) and pandemic (n = 129) periods, and no differences were observed for suicide methods,injury patterns, or length of hospital stay. Conclusion: Our data emphasize that a previously reported rise in psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemicdoes not coincide with increased SVSA rates or changes in quality of SVSAs.

LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.933858 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Individuals with psychiatric disorders may be both vulnerable andsensitive to rapid societal changes that have occurred during the COVID-19pandemic. To fully understand these impacts, repeated measurements of theseindividuals are warranted. The current longitudinal study set out to performmonthly assessment of individuals with common psychiatric disorders usingestablished questionnaires with a possibility for them to self- rate theirsymptoms, over time. Methods: Recruitment of individuals who identifiedthemselves as struggling with mental health problems, living in Sweden betweenJuly 2020 and June 2021 using an online survey. The individuals answeredquestions on demographics, psychiatric history, current psychiatric symptoms(e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9; General Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7),somatic health, health-care contacts and any changes therein during the pandemic.Monthly, longitudinal assessments are still ongoing (consenting participantsprovide data for 1 year), and here we present descriptive statistics from thebaseline measurement. All measurements from baseline (>400 items), and follow-upsare presented in detail. Results: A total of 6.095 participants (average age 35years) submitted complete baseline data. Marital status (43% single) and numberof years of education (48% highest degree being high school) were evenlydistributed in this population. The most common lifetime psychiatric disorder in the sample was depressive disorder (80.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder(45.9%), with a substantial proportion having severe symptoms of depression.(30.5%) and anxiety (37.1%). Lifetime suicidal ideation (75.0%) and non-suicidal self-harm (57.7%) were prevalent in the group and 14.5% reported drug use during the pandemic. Allergies (36.8%) were the most common somatic condition, followed by irritable bowel syndrome (18.7%). For those having experienced a traumaticevent, 39% showed symptoms during the pandemic indicating PTSD. Regarding contactwith mental health services during the pandemic, 22% had established a newcontact, and 20% reported to have increased their psychiatric medication comparedto before the pandemic. Conclusion: Baseline data collected during the pandemicfrom individuals in Sweden with pre-existing psychiatric disorders demonstratethat this sample represents a population suitable for an investigation on thelong-term impact of the pandemic, as intended by the longitudinal investigationthat is ongoing. Follow-up questionnaires over a 12-month period are beingcollected and will indicate how the health and well-being of this population was impacted during the changes and uncertainties that have been characteristic ofthe past 2 years.

AB  - Background: New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Lancet, Journal of theAmerican Medical Association (JAMA), and British Medical Journal (BMJ) arecollectively known as "the Top Four Medical Journals (TFMJ)" in China. Throughthe analysis of Chinese scholars' publications in the TFMJ in the recent 10years, this study aimed to clarify the current situation of high-quality medical research conducted by Chinese scholars and institutions. Methods: Data wereretrieved and downloaded manually from PubMed (2011-2020). Information on thepublication year, journal, author, affiliation, and citation, etc. were extractedand analyzed using R software. Results: A total of 761 articles were involved in the final analysis. The number of articles published by Chinese scholars in theTFMJ was 135/29,942 (0.45%) in BMJ, 124/14,033 (0.88%) in JAMA, 314/16,117(1.94%) in Lancet, and 188/15,242 (1.23%) in NEJM (P<0.001). Besides, the letter was the main research type, which was up to 44.54%, and the original researchonly accounted for 17.47%. The most popular subspecialty and subject wereinfectious diseases and COVID-19, respectively. The most productive researcherwas Chen Wang, and Bin Cao was the most cited Chinese scholar. The mostproductive institute was Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking UnionMedical College. The most cited study was "Clinical features of patients infectedwith 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China". Conclusions: The presence ofChinese scholars in the TFMJ has grown, but there is still much room to improve. A Matthew effect in China's high-level scientific research was demonstrated.

LID - 10.7150/ijms.76168 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause immunosuppression and cytokine storm, leading to lung damage and death. Theclinical efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in preventing viral entry into hostcells and suppressing viral replication remains inadequate. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)are crucial to the immune response to and pathogenesis of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. However, the specific roles of miRNAs in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2remain unclear. miRNAs can participate in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesisthrough at least four possible mechanisms: 1. host cell miRNA expressioninterfering with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, 2. SARS-CoV-2-derived RNA transcriptsacting as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that may attenuate host cell miRNAexpression, 3. host cell miRNA expression modulating SARS-CoV-2 replication, and 4. SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNAs silencing the expression of host protein-codinggenes. SARS-CoV-2-related miRNAs may be used as diagnostic or prognosticbiomarkers for predicting outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that dietary polyphenolic compoundsmay protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating host cell miRNAexpression. These findings have major implications for the future diagnosis andtreatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Rare diseases remain a challenge for many of the countries in the world. Themillions of people collectively suffering from rare diseases, in the context ofraging COVID-19 pandemics globally, require an innovative and recent solutionfrom different stakeholders. Regulatory bodies such as the Food and DrugAdministration and the European Medicines Agency have come up with many differentapproaches including financial assistance to prompt drug development andapproval. Novel approaches pertinent to clinical trials of such drugs such aspatient centricity, early interaction with regulatory bodies, and establishingclinical outcome of interest have been experimented. Various internationalorganizations including cross-country collaborators have initiated variousprojects or consortiums to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice. Thechallenges remain more pivotal in developing countries such as India, which hasadopted few noteworthy initiatives by involving relevant stakeholders in thepresence of limited resources, infrastructures, and a nascent regulatoryframework. Therefore, it is imperative to revisit the key aspects of orphan drug development to fulfill the unmet needs of such patients suffering from variousrare diseases.

TI  - How Can We Improve the Delivery of Urology Teaching to Medical Students UsingModern Educational Techniques?
PG  - 777-780
LID - 10.2147/AMEP.S372242 [doi]
AB  - It is generally well-known that the medical school curriculum is becomingincreasingly busy, more so with the COVID-19 pandemic. By itself, urologyeducation will need to adapt to meet the changing circumstances, but it remainsuncertain on how best to address this need. In this article, we will discussseveral methods that will allow institutions to ease and overcome pressures usingmodern educational techniques. These methods can be classified based on theaspect of the curriculum they seek to improve, namely core-curricular teaching,anatomy training, virtual reality, and electronic learning opportunities. Weanticipate that the implementation of these suggestions will enhance medicalschool teaching.

TI  - Electrospun Nanofibrous Membranes for Controlling Airborne Viruses: PresentStatus, Standardization of Aerosol Filtration Tests, and Future Development.
PG  - 290-309
LID - 10.1021/acsenvironau.1c00047 [doi]
AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has raised great public concern about the airbornetransmission of viral pathogens. Virus-laden aerosols with small size could besuspended in the air for a long duration and remain infectious. Among a series ofmeasures implemented to mitigate the airborne spread of infectious diseases,filtration by face masks, respirators, and air filters is a potentnonpharmacologic intervention. Compared with conventional air filtration media,nanofibrous membranes fabricated via electrospinning are promising candidates forcontrolling airborne viruses due to their desired characteristics, i.e., areduced pore size (submicrometers to several micrometers), a larger specificsurface area and porosity, and retained surface and volume charges. So far, awide variety of electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been developed for aerosolfiltration, and they have shown excellent filtration performance. However,current studies using electrospinning for controlling airborne viruses varysignificantly in the practice of aerosol filtration tests, including setupconfigurations and operations. The discrepancy among various studies makes itdifficult, if not impossible, to compare filtration performance. Therefore, thereis a pressing need to establish a standardized protocol for evaluating theelectrospun nanofibrous membranes' performance for removing viral aerosols. Inthis perspective, we first reviewed the properties and performance of diversefilter media, including electrospun nanofibrous membranes, for removing viralaerosols. Next, aerosol filtration protocols for electrospun nanofibrousmembranes were discussed with respect to the aerosol generation, filtration,collection, and detection. Thereafter, standardizing the aerosol filtration test system for electrospun nanofibrous membranes was proposed. In the end, the futureadvancement of electrospun nanofibrous membranes for enhanced air filtration was discussed. This perspective provides a comprehensive understanding of status and challenges of electrospinning for air filtration, and it sheds light on futurenanomaterial and protocol development for controlling airborne viruses,preventing the spread of infectious diseases, and beyond.

TI  - Second Booster BNT162b2 Restores SARS-CoV-2 Humoral Response in Patients WithMultiple Myeloma, Excluding Those Under Anti-BCMA Therapy.
PG  - e764
LID - 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000764 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 vaccination leads to a less intense humoral response in patients withmultiple myeloma (MM) compared with healthy individuals, whereas theSARS-CoV-2-specific immunity fades over time. The purpose of this study was toexplore the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in patientswith MM after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, focusing on theirresponse before (B4D) and at 1 month after the fourth vaccination (M1P4D).Overall, 201 patients with a median age of 67 years were included, whereas 114(56.7%) were men. The median NAbs levels B4D were 80.0% (+/-3.5%) and at M1P4Dthey increased to a median value of 96.1% (+/-3.7%). The NAb values at M1P4D weresimilar to those at 1 month post the third dose and superior to all previoustimepoints. At M1P4D, the NAbs levels of all the treatment groups increased,apart from the anti-BCMA group. A significant increase in median NAbs values was observed for those receiving CD38-based treatment (n = 43, from 71.0% B4D to96.0% at M1P4D) and those who did not receive CD38- or BCMA-targeted therapy (n =137, from 89.6% B4D to 96.3% at M1P4D). Regarding the patients under BCMA-basedtherapy (n = 21), there was no remarkable increase in NAbs values following thesecond booster shot (from 3.0% B4D to 4.0% at M1P4D). In conclusion, boostervaccination with the BNT162b2 results in a substantially improved humoralresponse against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with MM. Anti-BCMA treatment remains anadverse predictive factor for NAbs response; thus, tailored prevention measuresshould be considered for this patient subgroup.

TI  - Transition to wellness: developing a telehealth wellness program to addressstudent fieldwork challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.21037/mhealth-21-35 [doi]
AB  - The Transition to Wellness Program is an occupational therapy (OT) based program that was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For OT students,fieldwork is a required element of their training. In March 2020, these werebeing halted due to lockdowns and the risk to students in healthcare settings.Facing significant delays to graduation for 60 students, including some unable tobe placed into healthcare settings due to underlying conditions, the development of a telehealth program was conceived to address this, while still meeting theaccreditation clinical/health/wellness standards for OT fieldwork. A group ofstudents, with faculty oversight, developed the theoretical basis, tools,policies and procedures for the program. An incremental launch allowed testingand refinement of the program to meet the educational needs of the students andthe wellness needs of the clients. At its launch, the program supported 10 ofthat cohorts' 60 students to continue to meet the required academic standards andprogress through their fieldwork towards graduation. Each student got toexperience the "telehealth" model in providing OT wellness interventions toindividuals in the local community. Future work will focus on continuing tobroaden the reach of the program and measure the outcomes.

AB  - Background: Excessive inflammation contributes to the morbidity and mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Recombinant human plasmagelsolin (rhu-pGSN) improves disease outcomes in diverse experimental models ofinfectious and noninfectious inflammation. Methods: In a blinded, randomizedstudy, 61 subjects with documented COVID-19 pneumonia having a World HealthOrganization (WHO) Severity Score of 4 to 6 and evidence of a hyperinflammatorystate were treated with standard care and either adjunctive rhu-pGSN 12 mg/kg or an equal volume of saline placebo given intravenously at entry, 12 hours, and 36 hours. The prespecified coprimary outcomes were survival without majorrespiratory, hemodynamic, or renal support on Day 14 and the incidence of seriousadverse events (SAEs) during the 90-day study period. Results: All subjectsreceiving >/=1 dose of study drug were analyzed. Fifty-four of 61 subjects(88.5%) were WHO severity level 4 at entry. The proportions of subjects alivewithout support on Day 14 were 25 of 30 rhu-pGSN recipients (83.3%) and 27 of 31 placebo recipients (87.1%). Over the duration of the study, WHO Severity Scoresimproved similarly in both treatment groups. No statistically significantdifferences were observed between treatment groups at any time point examined.Two subjects died in each group. Numerically fewer subjects in the rhu-pGSN grouphad SAEs (5 subjects; 16.7%) or >/= Grade 3 adverse events (5 subjects; 16.7%)than in the placebo group (8 subjects [25.8%] and 9 subjects [29.0%],respectively), mostly involving the lungs. Three rhu-pGSN recipients (10.0%) wereintubated compared to 6 placebo recipients (19.4%). Conclusions: Overall,subjects in this study did well irrespective of treatment arm. When added todexamethasone and remdesivir, no definitive benefit was demonstrated for rhu-pGSNrelative to placebo. Safety signals were not identified after the administration of 3 doses of 12 mg/kg rhu-pGSN over 36 hours. The frequencies of SAEs andintubation were numerically fewer in the rhu-pGSN group compared with placebo.

AB  - We used human semi-synthetic phage antibody gene libraries to selectanti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD scFv antibody fragment and subsequent characterization ofthis novel tetravalent monoclonal antibody targeting conformational epitopes inthe receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Binding studies suggest that II62tetravalent antibody cross-reacts with RBD protein of SARS-CoV2 and its differentvariants of concerns. The epitope mapping data reveals that II62 tetravalentantibody targets an epitope that does not directly interferes with RBD: ACE2interaction. Neutralization studies with live authentic SARS-CoV2 virus suggests that increase in valency of II62 mAb from monovalent to tetravalent doesn'tperturbate virus interactions with the ACE2 expressing host cells in cytopathiceffect-based (CPE) assay.

AB  - The impact of two years of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship betweenemployers and employees are explored, including changing employee sensibilitieswith respect to future employment, work-life balance, remote and flexible work,and the great resignation. Lasting work changes induced by the pandemic expandemployee empowerment and demand for greater work flexibility. Flexibility nolonger provides employers a unique selling point and hiring/retentioncompetitiveness - it has become an expected standard. Evolving workplaceexpectations are tied to realizations of the value of work within the broadercontext of employees' lives, changing business culture across many industries.Demand for increased work/employment individualization and personalizationoverlaps unprecedented personalization of and power of mobile technologies.Human-centered employee management in the post-COVID-19 era will becomeimperative, with many opportunities for employers to enable greater impact inemployee wellness and health promotion driven by deploying compellingvirtual-remote engagement and behavioral change technologies.

TI  - Self-reported side effects of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine amonghealthcare workers in Ethiopia, Africa: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 937794
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.937794 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa. Ethiopiareceived most of its COVID-19 vaccines through donations. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is the first to be donated to Ethiopia by the COVAX facility. Healthcare workers were the priority population that received the Oxford AstraZenecaCOVID-19 vaccine. However, there was no nationwide study on the safety of thevaccine in Ethiopia. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and predictors ofself-reported side effects of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Materials andmethods: The study employed a cross-sectional design. A sample of healthcareworkers who took Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was drawn from four regions of Ethiopia; namely, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, and Southwest. Data were collectedon sociodemographic characteristics, medical anamnesis, COVID-19 relatedanamnesis, and COVID-19 vaccine anamnesis via telephone interview. Descriptiveand inferential analyses were done. The software, IBM SPSS Statistics v21.0, was used for analyses of data. Results: Out of 384 people, 346 responded (responserate: 90.1%). Female accounted for 34.1% of the respondents. The mean age of the respondents was 31.0 years (Standard Deviation (SD) = 7.4). Nurses accounted for 43.7% of the respondents. The prevalence of at least one local- and systemic-sideeffect was 50.6 and 44.5%, respectively. The most frequent local- and systemic-side effect were injection site pain and headache, respectively. Both types ofside effects mostly subsided in the first 3 days. A third of healthcare workerswith side effects took at least one medication. Paracetamol followed bydiclofenac sodium were taken by healthcare workers to overcome side effects.There was no independent predictor of local side effect. After controlling forage and chronic diseases, the odds of healthcare workers with COVID-19 likesymptoms to experience systemic side effects was 1.38 (Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-1.82) times more than that of healthcare workers without COVID-19 likesymptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of local- and systemic-side effects of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was modest. As the symptoms were mostlycommon in the first 3 days, it is preferable to monitor healthcare workers atleast in the first 3 days following the administration of the vaccine.

PG  - 904550
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.904550 [doi]
AB  - Objective: After the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the health status of the general population has suffered a huge threat, and themental health of front-line healthcare providers has also encountered greatchallenges. Therefore, this study aims to: (1) investigate the prevalence andinfluencing factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among healthcareproviders, and (2) verify the moderating role of self-efficacy in the influenceof PTSD on mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using anonline survey of 1993 participants. The presence of depression, anxiety,self-efficacy, and PTSD was evaluated using screening tests from March 1.Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data were also collected. A data analysiswas performed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient,and multiple linear regression. Results: The prevalence of PTSD among healthcare providers was 9.3%. PTSD was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r =-0.265, P < 0.01), anxiety (r = -0.453, P < 0.01), and depression (r = 0.708, P <0.01). Profession, daily working hours, maximum continuous working days, anddaily sleep time were influencing factors of PTSD. A binary logistic regressionanalysis showed that physicians (OR = 2.254, 95% CI = 1.298, 3.914) and nurses(OR = 2.176, 95% CI = 1.337, 3.541) were more likely to experience PTSD thanother healthcare providers. Conclusion: Self-efficacy has a moderating effect on the influence of PTSD on anxiety and depression. This suggests that healthmanagers need to respond to the current psychological crisis of healthcareproviders, implement appropriate psychological interventions, and minimize thepsychological harm caused by COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Vaccination is the best means of reducing the increased risk ofsevere COVID-19 during pregnancy. Data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake among pregnant women in Ethiopia is scarce. Thus, this study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccineuptake and associated factors among pregnant women. Method: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 634 pregnant women attending antenatal care in Debre Tabor public health institutions from March 14 to 30, 2022.Participants were recruited using a multistage sampling technique and data werecollected via face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested structuredquestionnaire. Stata version 16.0 software was used for data analysis. Multiplelogistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake, with a p-value< 0.05 considered statistically significant.Result: Only 14.4% (95% CI: 11.7%-17.3%) of participants had received at leastone dose of COVID-19 vaccines. The main reasons for declining vaccination werefear that the COVID-19 vaccine may have harmful side effects on the fetus or the mother. Being 45 or older (AOR: 1.75, 95%CI: 1.01-2.95), being married (AOR:1.26, 95%CI: 1.12, 2.96), having good knowledge (AOR:3.52, 95%CI:1.83-3.87), and a positive attitude (AOR:4.81, 95% CI: 1.42-7.33) were positive predictors ofCOVID-19 vaccine uptake. But attaining a college or university education (AOR:0.43, 95%CI: 0.12-0.69) was found to be a barrier to vaccine uptake by pregnantwomen. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women was substantiallylow. Old age, being married, low education, good knowledge, and a positiveattitude were significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. To enhance theCOVID-19 vaccine uptake, the government should improve the knowledge and attitudeof pregnant women toward the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads rapidly,causing outbreaks that grow exponentially within a short period beforeinterventions are sought and effectively implemented. Testing is part of thefirst line of defense against Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), playing a critical role in the early identification and isolation of cases to slowtransmission, provision of targeted care to those affected, and protection ofhealth system operations. Laboratory tests for COVID-19 based on nucleic acidamplification techniques were rapidly developed in the early days of thepandemic, but such tests typically require sophisticated laboratoryinfrastructure and skilled staff. In March 2020, Zimbabwe confirmed its firstcase of COVID-19; this was followed by an increase in infection rates as thepandemic spread across the country, thus increasing the demand for testing. Onenational laboratory was set to test all the country's COVID-19 suspect cases,building pressure on human and financial resources. Staff burnout and longerturnaround times of more than 48 h were experienced, and results were releasedlate for clinical relevance. Leveraging on existing PCR testing platforms,including GeneXpert machines, eased the pressure for a short period before facingthe stockout of SARs-CoV-2 cartridges for a long time, leading to work overloadat a few testing sites contributing to long turnaround times. On September 11,WHO released the interim guidance to use antigen rapid diagnostic test as adiagnostic tool. The Zimbabwe laboratory pillar quickly adopted it and made plansfor its implementation. The National Microbiology Reference Laboratory verifiedthe two emergency-listed kits, the Panbio Abbott and the Standard Q, Biosensor,and they met the WHO minimum performance of >/=97% specificity and >/=80%sensitivity. Decentralizing diagnostic testing leveraging existing humanresources became a game-changer in improving COVID-19 containment measures. Task shifting through training on Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) commenced,and testing was decentralized to all the ten provinces, from 1 central testinglaboratory to more than 1,000 testing centers. WhatsApp platforms made it easier for data to be reported from remote areas. Result turnaround times were improved to the same day, and accessibility to testing was enhanced.

AB  - In response to the economic and social hazards posed by the COVID-19 globalpandemic, many countries have adopted various information technologies to rapidlytrack and control the spread of the epidemic. Health Quick Response (QR) codesare emergency measures implemented by the Chinese government in the epidemicenvironment to balance epidemic prevention and control with recovery of economic and social development, and facilitate public mobility across regions and access to various public spaces. The use of health codes by the public is a practicalnecessity, but the satisfaction of their use is influenced by multiple factorssuch as environment, technology, and organization. In this paper, we collecteddata through a questionnaire to analyze the basic situation of publicsatisfaction with the use of health QR codes in China and its influencingfactors. The results show that perceived quality and platform trust directlyaffect the satisfaction of health code usage, while environmental risk andplatform trust indirectly affect the satisfaction of health code usage throughthe mediating effect of perceived quality.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the globalexperiences of community responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. Method: Fiveelectronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English, from inception to October 10, 2021. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, andfull texts. A systematic review (with a scientific strategy for literature searchand selection in the electronic databases applied to data collection) was used toinvestigate the experiences of community responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.Results: This review reported that community responses to COVID-19 consistedmainly of five ways. On the one hand, community-based screening and testing forCoronavirus was performed; on the other hand, the possible sources oftransmission in communities were identified and cut off. In addition, communitiesprovided medical aid for patients with mild cases of COVID-19. Moreover, socialsupport for community residents, including material and psychosocial support, wasprovided to balance epidemic control and prevention and its impact on residents' lives. Last and most importantly, special care was provided to vulnerableresidents during the epidemic. Conclusion: This study systematically reviewed howcommunities to respond to COVID-19. The findings presented some practical anduseful tips for communities still overwhelmed by COVID-19 to deal with theepidemic. Also, some community-based practices reported in this review couldprovide valuable experiences for community responses to future epidemics.

AB  - Based on the context of communication and use of online communities in China,this study explored the characteristics and defects of risk communication of the government and official media in the event of COVID-19, as well as the factorsthat affected people's perception of the risk and protective behavior. Thefollowing results were found: (1) The government and official (mainstream) media accounts suffered from information lag in the early stage of COVID-19, whileself-media accounts played the role of risk sensors, which caused people to have less trust in the government and the authorities and turn to the truth onself-media accounts. However, the low accessibility of self-media accounts andthe imperfect check mechanism provided a hotbed for rumors, which further led to more fear and worry about risks. (2) During the middle and later periods ofCOVID-19, the government and the official media began to pay attention to theinfluence of self-media on peoples' emotions and behavior, and gradually improvedthe supervision of online information and the operation of official mediaaccounts. This is intended to achieve information consistently and linkmechanisms between official media and self-media to prevent and correct mistakes,as well as to achieve effective risk communication of information transparency,opinion exchange, and public sentiment stabilization.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to determine the efficacy, effectiveness, andcost-effectiveness of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines (CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) inChina using existing international clinical trials and real-world evidence.Methods: Through a search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI, studiesinvestigating the effectiveness of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines were identified,and a meta-analysis was undertaken to synthesize the vaccine efficacy andeffectiveness data. Moreover, a decision-analytic model was developed to estimatethe cost-effectiveness of inactivated vaccines for combating the COVID-19pandemic in the Chinese context from a societal perspective. Results of themeta-analysis, along with cost data from official websites and works ofliterature were used to populate the model. Sensitivity analysis was performed totest the robustness of the model results. Results: A total of 24 studies wereincluded in the meta-analysis. In comparison to no immunization, theeffectiveness of inactivated vaccine against COVID-19 infection, hospitalization,ICU admission and death were 65.18% (95% CI 62.62, 67.75), 79.10% (95% CI 71.69, 86.51), 90.46% (95% CI 89.42, 91.50), and 86.69% (95% CI 85.68, 87.70); and theefficacy against COVID-19 infection and hospitalization were 70.56% (95% CI57.87, 83.24) and 100% (95% CI 61.72, 100). Inactivated vaccine vaccinationprevented more infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths withlower total costs, thus was cost-saving from a societal perspective in China.Base-case analysis results were robust in the one-way sensitivity analysis, andthe percentage of ICU admission or death and direct medical cost ranked the topinfluential factors in our models. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis,vaccination had a 100% probability of being cost-effective. Conclusion:Inactivated vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 infection,hospitalization, ICU admission and avoiding COVID-19 related death, and COVID-19 vaccination program is cost-saving from societal perspective in China.

AB  - At present, COVID-19 is spreading widely around the world. It causes many health problems, namely, respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.Wearable devices have gained popularity by allowing remote COVID-19 detection,contact tracing, and monitoring. In this study, the correlation ofphotoplethysmogram (PPG) morphology between patients with COVID-19 infection and healthy subjects was investigated. Then, machine learning was used to classifythe extracted features between 43 cases and 43 control subjects. The PPG datawere collected from 86 subjects based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thesystolic-onset amplitude was 3.72% higher for the case group. However, the timeinterval of systolic-systolic was 7.69% shorter in the case than in controlsubjects. In addition, 12 out of 20 features exhibited a significant difference. The top three features included dicrotic-systolic time interval, onset-dicroticamplitude, and systolic-onset time interval. Nine features extracted by heatmapbased on the correlation matrix were fed to discriminant analysis, k-nearestneighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, and artificial neural network(ANN). The ANN showed the best performance with 95.45% accuracy, 100%sensitivity, and 90.91% specificity by using six input features. In this study, aCOVID-19 prediction model was developed using multiple PPG features extractedusing a low-cost pulse oximeter.

AB  - In the wake of COVID-19, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become termed the'silent pandemic', with a growing number of editorials warning that internationalmomentum for AMR mitigation is being lost amidst the global turmoil of COVID-19, economic crises and the climate emergency. Yet, is it sufficient to now simplyturn the volume of the pre-existing AMR policy discourse back up? Althoughexisting AMR initiatives have previously achieved high levels of internationalattention, their impact remains limited. We believe it is time to criticallyreflect on the achievements of the past 7 years and adapt our AMR policies based on the substantial literature and evidence base that exists on thesocioecological drivers of AMR. We argue that developing a more sustainable andimpactful response requires a shift away from framing AMR as a unique threat incompetition with other global challenges. Instead, we need to move towards anapproach that emphasizes AMR as inherently interlinked and consciously hardwires upstream interventions into broader global developmental agendas.

AB  - Background: The emergence of the COVID pandemic unfolded a series of precautions and dilemmas and the complete suspension of health services. With the gradualemergence of data showing near minimal effects of the virus on pregnancy,Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) services were gradually resumed following guidelines and advisories. Aim: The purpose of this study was to detect the COVIDpositivity rate in women undergoing ART treatment during the COVID pandemic andcompare clinical and embryological outcomes to the ART cycles performed in thepre-COVID era. Study Setting and Design: This was a retrospective cohort study ofall women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by a fresh orfrozen embryo transfer (ET) between 1st October 2019 and 31st March 2020 (controlgroup) and between 1st April 2020 and 31st September 2020 (study group) at NovaIVF Fertility Clinic, Ahmedabad. Material and Methods: The study group underwent ART during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India and when gradualunlocking of facilities including ART was advised as per the national ARTadvisory by the ICMR in December 2020. The outcomes were compared with thecontrol group (cycles in pre-covid time). Statistical Analysis: Statisticalanalysis was performed in SPSS (v25.0) and included Mann-Whitney U, Fisher'sexact and Pearson Chi-square as appropriate. Values of P < 0.05 were consideredstatistically significant. Results: A total of 367 in vitro fertilisation (IVF)stimulations were initiated. A total of 342 retrievals and 606 ETs (171 fresh and435 frozen) were completed during the study period with a COVID positivity rateof 6.8% (25/367) amongst fresh and 3.9% (18/453) amongst frozen ETs,respectively; the PR and IR in the study group was similar to the control group(47.6 vs. 55.1 P = 0.4 and 68.7 vs. 66.4; P = 0.52, respectively). The maternalcomplication rates were similar in both groups with a COVID positivity rate of10.2% (23/225) and 1 maternal death in the study group. The live birth rates weresimilar. Conclusions: We did not find a noteworthy difference in the clinical andembryological outcomes in the IVF cycles conducted in the COVID era as comparedto the pre-COVID time. Thus, with adequate precautions and safety measures, ARTservices conducted during the COVID pandemic have comparable birth outcomes andcan be safely advocated.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, questions have been raised about the impact of facemasks on communication in classroom settings. However, it is unclear to whatextent visual obstruction of the speaker's mouth or changes to the acousticsignal lead to speech processing difficulties, and whether these effects can bemitigated by semantic predictability, i.e., the availability of contextualinformation. The present study investigated the acoustic and visual effects offace masks on speech intelligibility and processing speed under varying semantic predictability. Twenty-six children (aged 8-12) and twenty-six adults performedan internet-based cued shadowing task, in which they had to repeat aloud the lastword of sentences presented in audio-visual format. The results showed thatchildren and adults made more mistakes and responded more slowly when listeningto face mask speech compared to speech produced without a face mask. Adults were only significantly affected by face mask speech when both the acoustic and thevisual signal were degraded. While acoustic mask effects were similar forchildren, removal of visual speech cues through the face mask affected childrento a lesser degree. However, high semantic predictability reduced audio-visualmask effects, leading to full compensation of the acoustically degraded maskspeech in the adult group. Even though children did not fully compensate for facemask speech with high semantic predictability, overall, they still profited from semantic cues in all conditions. Therefore, in classroom settings, strategiesthat increase contextual information such as building on students' priorknowledge, using keywords, and providing visual aids, are likely to help overcomeany adverse face mask effects.

AB  - Unprecedentedly impacted by COVID-19, tourism enterprises are pushed to adopt newstrategic management to cope with the changes in tourists' consumer perceptionfor sustainable development, such as corporate and compete simultaneously withtheir competitors. Our study aims to investigate the intermediate role ofcoopetition, including the three dimensions of resource similarity, marketcommonality, and willingness to cooperate in the marketing and performancerelationships. Primary data on 360 observers were collected via questionnairedistribution to theme park managers in China with 85.3% accuracy in responserate. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to verify the intermediateeffect of coopetition on marketing performance in tourism enterprises. Theresults of SEM indicate (1) the intermediate role of tourism coopetition,including the three dimensions existing in the relationship between tourismmarketing and performance, (2) more significant positive impact on non-financial performance than that on financial performance, and (3) the mechanism ofimplementing coopetition. This study gives supportive evidence for tourismenterprises to implement coopetition and highlights the implications forappropriately developing coopetition strategies and tactics to achieve thesynergy effect for the individual enterprises and the spillover effect for thedestination regarding policy-making, mindset, and partner selection.

AB  - Objective: This study focuses on positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic andaims to identify associations between gender, individual quarantine and duration of the COVID-19 (short- medium- and long-term pandemic), and posttraumatic growth(PTG). Method: The data was collected via an online survey in Israel, andincluded 1,301 participants, 543 participants experienced short-term pandemics,428 participants experienced medium-term pandemics and 330 participantsexperienced long-term pandemics. Most of the participants were female (73.6%),ranging from 18 to 89 years-old. The participants answered questions about their demographic background, individual quarantine experiences and ranked their PTGlevel. Results: The results indicate a significant main effect of gender andpandemic duration (short-, medium- and long-term pandemic). Women reported higherPTG levels than men, and participants experiencing short-term pandemic reportedsignificantly lower PTG levels than participants experiencing medium- orlong-term pandemic. There was also a significant interaction between gender andpandemic duration regarding PTG and a significant interaction in PTG by gender,pandemic duration and individual quarantine. Conclusion: The discussion addressesthe findings in the context of traditional gender roles and gender differences infinding meaning and worth in home confinement situations.

AB  - This study examined the potential impacts of entrepreneurial leadership onfollowers' psychological wellbeing and proactive work behavior throughsustainable employability and work uncertainty in a sample of 218 employeesemployed in SMEs of Pakistan. Hierarchical regression results demonstrated thatentrepreneurial leadership was positively connected with sustainableemployability and negatively linked with work uncertainty. Sequentially,sustainable employability was positively correlated with proactive work behavior and employees' psychological wellbeing, and work uncertainty was negativelyassociated with proactive work behavior and employees' psychological wellbeingduring the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, bootstrapping confirmed the mediationeffects of work uncertainty and sustainable employability on proactive workbehavior and the psychological wellbeing of employees. Sustainable employability did not mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership andpsychological wellbeing. Mediators, sustainable employability, and workuncertainty positively linked employees' psychological wellbeing and proactivework behavior. The results highlighted the significant roles of sustainableemployability and work uncertainty and interpreted why entrepreneurial leadershipmay affect employees' positive behaviors.

AB  - As the fear of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic subsides,countries around the globe are now dealing with a fear of the epidemicsurrounding the prevalence of monkeypox cases in various regions. Previouslyendemic to regions of Africa, the majority of monkeypox cases associated with the2022 outbreak are being noted in countries around Europe and in the westernhemisphere. While contact-tracing projects are being conducted by variousorganizations, it is unknown how this outbreak began. Monkeypox virus is one ofthe many zoonotic viruses that belong to the Orthopoxvirus genus of thePoxviridae family. Monkeypox cases received global attention during the 1970s,after the global eradication of smallpox. The smallpox vaccine providedcross-immunity to the monkeypox virus. Upon the cessation of smallpox vaccineadministration, monkeypox cases became more prevalent. It was not until the 2003 US outbreak that monkeypox truly gained global attention. Despite the virus beingnamed monkeypox, monkeys are not the origin of the virus. Several rodents andsmall mammals have been attributed as the source of the virus; however, it isunknown what the true origin of monkeypox is. The name monkeypox is due to theviral infection being first witnessed in macaque monkeys. Though human-to-humantransmission of monkeypox is very rare, it is commonly attributed to respiratory droplets or direct contact with mucocutaneous lesions of an infected individual. Currently, there is no treatment allocated for infected individuals, however,supportive treatments can be administered to provide symptom relief toindividuals; Medications such as tecovirimat may be administered in very severecases. These treatments are subjective, as there are no exact guidelines forsymptom relief.

AB  - Background The incidence of geriatric hip fractures, respiratory infections(e.g., coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza), and mortality is higherduring the fall and winter. The purpose of this study is to assess whether theaddition of seasonality to a validated geriatric inpatient mortality risk toolwill improve the predictive capacity and risk stratification for geriatric hipfracture patients. We hypothesize that seasonality will improve the predictivecapacity. Methodology Between October 2014 and August 2021, 2,421 patients>55-year-old treated for hip fracture were analyzed for demographics, date ofpresentation, COVID-19 status (for patients after February 2020), and mortality. Patients were grouped by season based on their admission dates into the followingfour cohorts: fall (September-November), winter (December-February), spring(March-May), and summer (June-August). Patients presenting during the fall/winterand spring/summer were compared. The baseline Score for Trauma Triage in theGeriatric and Middle-Aged (STTGMA) tool for hip fractures (STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE)and the seasonality iteration (STTGMA_SEASON) were also compared. Sub-analysiswas conducted on 687 patients between February 2020 and August 2021 amid theCOVID-19 pandemic. The baseline score (STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE) and the COVID-19iteration (STTGMACOVID_ORIGINAL_2020) were modified to include seasonality(STTGMA_COVID/SEASON). Patients were stratified by risk score and compared. Thepredictive ability of the models was compared using DeLong's test. Results Forthe overall cohort, patients who presented during the fall/winter had a higherrate of inpatient mortality (2.87% vs. 1.25%, p < 0.01). STTGMA_SEASON improvedthe predictive capacity for inpatient mortality compared to STTGMAHIP_FX_SCOREbut not significantly (0.773 vs. 0.672, p = 0.105) On sub-analysis, regressionweighting showed a coefficient of 0.643, with fall and winter having a greaterabsolute effect size (fall = 2.572, winter = 1.929, spring = 1.286, summer =0.643). STTGMA_COVID/SEASON improved the predictive capacity for inpatientmortality compared to STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE (0.882 vs. 0.581, p < 0.01) andSTTGMACOVID_ORIGINAL_2020 (0.882 vs. 0.805, p = 0.04). The highest risk quartile contained 89.5% of patients who expired during their index inpatienthospitalization (p < 0.01) and 68.2% of patients who died within 30 days ofdischarge (p < 0.01). Conclusions Seasonality may play a role in both theincidence and impact of COVID-19 and additional respiratory infections. Includingseasonality improves the predictive capacity and risk stratification of theSTTGMA tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows for effective triage andcloser surveillance of high-risk geriatric hip fracture patients by betteraccounting for the increased respiratory infection incidence and the associatedmortality risk seen during fall and winter.

AB  - Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a disease related tocoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although the effects of COVID-19 on manysystems are known, there is limited data regarding its effects on the endocrinesystem. This study aimed to discuss the effect of COVID-19 on cortisol dynamicsin a patient who developed adrenal insufficiency after COVID-19 infection. An11-yr-old boy with polymerase chain reaction-proven COVID-19 one month previouslywas referred with a five-day history of fever, vomiting, and rash. On admission, he had hypotension, tachycardia, and severe hyponatremia. After the evaluation,he was diagnosed with MIS-C and glucocorticoid therapy was initiated. Duringfollow-up, the patient experienced adrenal insufficiency, and hydrocortisonetreatment was initiated at a crisis dose. Four months later, the adrenal axisfunction had not recovered. The adrenocortical response in COVID-19 patients may be significantly impaired, resulting in increased mortality or morbidity.

AB  - Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, thescientific community has tried to protect the population from the infection andits effects through multiple lines of evidence. Patients at high risk ofdeveloping severe disease were advised to protect themselves and practiceeffective physical distancing. Phenotypes specific to this infection need to bereviewed to understand COVID-19 and its clinical manifestations. When thepandemic began, the scientific community was concerned with the unfavorableoutcome of cases with pre-existing liver disease. There have been speculationsabout risk factors for severe diseases such as liver disease, age, gender, andassociation with obesity or diabetes.

AB  - Patients with hemodialysis face various problems with self-care behavior.Therefore, these patients need to control and manage adherence to enhanceself-care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has particularly highmorbidity in the elderly and co-morbid peoples. Self-efficacy was identified as anumber of psychological factors that improve adherence and treatment outcomesamong hemodialysis patients. This study aimed to investigate self-efficacy among patients with hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparativedescriptive research design was used to conduct the study. A convenience sampleof 95 hemodialysis patients (male and females) was selected from Port-Said city, Egypt, and 115 hemodialysis patients (male and females) were selected from Saudi Arabia. Data collection included a structured interview with three partsassessing socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, andself-efficacy. This study revealed a statistically significant difference betweenEgyptian and Saudi hemodialysis patients, mainly in the main score and levels of self-efficacy (p=0.001). There is a significant relationship betweensocio-demographic characteristics and chronic disease self-efficiency amongEgyptian hemodialysis patients in terms of sex, age, marital status, work, andlevel of education.

AB  - Alloimmune responses in kidney transplant (KT) patients previously hospitalizedwith COVID-19 are understudied. We analyzed a cohort of 112 kidney transplantrecipients who were hospitalized following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test resultduring the first 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a cumulativeincidence of 17% for the development of new donor-specific antibodies (DSA) orincreased levels of pre-existing DSA in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected KTpatients. This risk extended 8 months post-infection. These changes in DSA statuswere associated with late allograft dysfunction. Risk factors for new orincreased DSA responses in this KT patient cohort included the presence ofcirculating DSA pre-COVID-19 diagnosis and time post-transplantation. COVID-19vaccination prior to infection and remdesivir administration during infectionwere each associated with decreased likelihood of developing a new or increasedDSA response. These data show that new or enhanced DSA responses frequently occuramong KT patients requiring admission with COVID-19 and suggest thatsurveillance, vaccination, and antiviral therapies may be important tools toprevent alloimmunity in these individuals.

AB  - Identification of epitopes targeted following virus infection or vaccination can guide vaccine design and development of therapeutic interventions targetingfunctional sites, but can be laborious. Herein, we employed peptide microarraysto map linear peptide epitopes (LPEs) recognized following SARS-CoV-2 infectionand vaccination. LPEs detected by nonhuman primate (NHP) and patient IgMs afterSARS-CoV-2 infection extensively overlapped, localized to functionally important virus regions, and aligned with reported neutralizing antibody binding sites.Similar LPE overlap occurred after infection and vaccination, with LPE clustersspecific to each stimulus, where strong and conserved LPEs mapping to sites knownor likely to inhibit spike protein function. Vaccine-specific LPEs tended to map to sites known or likely to be affected by structural changes induced by theproline substitutions in the mRNA vaccine's S protein. Mapping LPEs to regions ofknown functional importance in this manner may accelerate vaccine evaluation and discovery of targets for site-specific therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has forced health and education services to use additional human resources, such as health professionalstudents. Students in the health professions, particularly those in the medicalfield, can participate in a variety of voluntary activities, both directly andindirectly in health services. The aim of this review was to determine theaffecting factors, types of activity, and benefits of undertaking a volunteering role by the health professional student. Methods: A systematic review of healthprofessional student volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic was conductedusing seven databases: Epistemonikos, ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCOhost, JSTOR,Cochrane Library, and PubMed. This literature search included published articles from March 2020 through to December 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Result: Weincluded 41 studies that met the selection criteria that assessed the factors andspecific programs related to health profession students' volunteering involvementduring the COVID-19 pandemic era. The most frequently observed supporting factor of the eagerness to be a volunteer was the feeling of moral responsibility (such as social dedication, sense of duty, and care), potential learning opportunities,personal interest, and financial compensation. Factors that contributed to aperson's refusal to participate in a volunteer position were the fear of COVID-19itself (such as transmission, risk of being infected, and personal identificationas a risk group). Conclusion: The review of available literature has shown thatunderstanding the motivation and barriers to the willingness of healthprofessional students to volunteer and the impact of volunteering activities ontheir future lives is a key for supporting them.

PG  - 957169
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.957169 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: There have been concerns regarding the potential exacerbationof autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) following vaccination against COVID-19during the pandemic. In the current study, vaccine safety was evaluated inpatients with AIBDs. Methods: In this study, patients with AIBDs were contactedvia face-to-face visits or phone calls. Patient demographics, vaccine-relatedinformation, pre- and post-vaccine disease status, and complications wererecorded. The exacerbation was considered either relapse in theremission/controlled phase of the disease or disease worsening in the activephase. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression tests were employed todetermine the potential risk factors of disease exacerbation. Results: Of thepatients contacted, 446 (74.3%) reported receiving at least one dose of vaccineinjection (54.7% female). Post-vaccine exacerbation occurred in 66 (14.8%)patients. Besides, there were 5 (1.1%) patients with AIBD diagnosis aftervaccination. According to the analysis, for every three patients who receivedvaccines during the active phase of the disease one experienced diseaseexacerbation. The rate of disease exacerbation increased by three percent withevery passing month from the last rituximab infusion. Active disease in the past year was another risk factor with a number needed to harm of 10. Conclusion: Riskof AIBD exacerbation after the COVID-19 vaccine is not high enough to preventvaccination. This unwanted side effect, can be reduced if the disease iscontrolled at the time of vaccination.

LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.890417 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had an enormous impact on healthcaredelivery globally. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in Turkey toevaluate the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare services in Turkey. A 35-itemanonymized online survey was completed by HCPs (medical doctors, MD) whocontinued their clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey,regardless of their specialties or degrees. Overall, 209 HCPs participated in thestudy. Forty-two percent of the participants stated that their current workloadintensity has been increased compared with the pre-pandemic era. More than halfof the participants (54.6%) were using telemedicine services during theirclinical practice, however, the effectiveness of telemedicine for first-timepatients and follow-up patients was rated as low. The majority of participants(59.3%) reported that during the peak period of the pandemic, they encounteredonly a small variety of cases, other than COVID-19. Fifty-two percent of theparticipants agreed that they occasionally had patients who received misdiagnosisin the first admission due to the suspicion of a possible COVID-19 infectionpredominating the diagnostic process (eg., not excluding COVID-19 even though thePCR test is negative). For the distribution of possible late-diagnosed diseases, 25.8% of HCPs selected chest diseases, followed by infectious diseases, heartdiseases, and cancer. In general, participants agreed that there was an increase in the negligence in the follow-up of various diseases and/or complication rates due to COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty percent of the HCPs agreed that HCPs are beingmuch more rigorous to diagnose/treating COVID-19 than other important diseases.Fifty-seven percent of the participants stated that the diagnosis and follow-upof chronic diseases are affected, while 57.9% of the HCPs stated that somediseases that show similar signs and symptoms as COVID-19 are not diagnosedcorrectly during COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study emphasize thatCOVID-19 pandemic has significantly caused delayed diagnoses and interruption in the management of chronic diseases, and also increased the risk of missing outthe diagnosis of non-COVID-19 diseases. The study genuinely aims to yield thefloor to a permanent improvement in post-pandemic clinical management and it alsoshows the need for a focused approach in distinct areas of medical care.Policymaking is required to drive changes to better support HCPs in Turkey.

PG  - 911273
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.911273 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) has been associatedwith a decreased risk of developing a variety of chronic diseases that arecomorbidities in COVID-19 patients. However, its association to the severity and symptoms of COVID-19 are still unknown. This study aimed to examine theassociation between adherence to the MD pattern and COVID-19 severity andsymptoms in Iranian hospitalized patients. Methods: In this cross-sectionalstudy, 250 COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 65 were examined. We employed a foodfrequency questionnaire (FFQ) to obtain data on dietary intake of participants inthe year prior to their COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was determinedusing the National Institutes of Health's Coronavirus Disease 2019 report.Additionally, symptoms associated with COVID-19, inflammatory markers, and other variables were evaluated. The scoring method proposed by Trichopoulou et al. was used to assess adherence to the MD. Results: The participants' mean age was 44.1 +/- 12.1 years, and 46% of them had severe COVID-19. Patients who adhered moreclosely to the MD had lower serum C-reactive protein levels (7.80 vs. 37.36 mg/l)and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (14.08 vs. 42.65 mm/h). Those with the highestMD score were 77% less likely to have severe COVID-19 after controlling forconfounding variables. The MD score was also found to be inversely associatedwith COVID-19 symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, fever, chills, weakness,myalgia, nausea and vomiting, and sore throat. Conclusion: Higher adherence tothe MD was associated with a decreased likelihood of COVID-19 severity andsymptoms, as well as a shorter duration of hospitalization and convalescence, andinflammatory biomarkers.

AB  - Cystic lung formation secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was described during coronavirus disease pandemic, butwith relatively low prevalence. A rare yet under-recognized complication is that these cystic areas may progress to bullae, cavities and pneumothorax. We reportedtwo cases of ruptured bullae with pneumothorax following SARS-CoV-2 infection.Two patients were discharged following SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which did notrequire invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). However, both patients presentedagain a month later with shortness of breath. Repeated computed tomography (CT)thorax showed development of bullous lung disease and pneumothorax. The firstpatient underwent surgical intervention whilst the second patient was treatedconservatively. Development of bullous lung disease following SARS-CoV-2infection is rare but may be associated with serious morbidity. Patients whosegeneral condition permits should be offered surgical intervention whilstconservative management is reserved for non-surgical candidates.

TI  - Predictors of mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Asingle-centre retrospective analysis.
PG  - 98-102
LID - 10.29390/cjrt-2022-019 [doi]
AB  - Background: The severity of disease and mortality due to coronavirus disease(COVID-19) was found to be high among patients with concurrent medical illnesses.Serum biomarkers can be used to predict the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. Datafrom India are very scarce about predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients.Methodology: In the present retrospective study of 65 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19patients, we retrieved data regarding clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters,and radiological grading of severity. Further, we also collected data about theirhospital course, duration of stay, treatment, and outcome. Data analysis was doneto compare the patient characteristics between survivor and non-survivor groupsand to assess the predictors of mortality. Results: The mean age of the studypopulation was 56.23 years (SD, 12.91) and most of them were males (63%); 81.5%of patients survived and were discharged, whereas 18.5% of patients succumbed to the disease. Univariate analysis across both groups showed that older age,diabetes mellitus, higher computed tomogram (CT) severity score, and raisedlevels of laboratory parameters viz, D-dimer, CPK-MB (creatine kinase), andlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were associated with increased mortality amonghospitalized patients. On multivariate analysis, elevated levels of serum D-dimer(odds ratio, 95% CI: 10.98, 1.13-106.62, p = 0.04) and LDH (odds ratio, 95% CI:19.15, 3.28-111.87, p = 0.001) were independently associated with mortality.Conclusion: Older patients, diabetics, and patients with high CT severity scores at admission are at increased risk of death from COVID-19. Serum biomarkers such as D-dimer and LDH help in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a tightrelationship with the immune system. Human resistance to COVID-19 infectioncomprises two stages. The first stage is immune defense, while the second stageis extensive inflammation. This process is further divided into innate andadaptive immunity during the immune defense phase. These two stages involvevarious immune cells, including CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, monocytes,dendritic cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Various immune cells areinvolved and make up the complex and unique immune system response to COVID-19,providing characteristics that set it apart from other respiratory infectiousdiseases. In the present study, we identified cell markers for differentiatingCOVID-19 from common inflammatory responses, non-COVID-19 severe respiratorydiseases, and healthy populations based on single-cell profiling of the geneexpression of six immune cell types by using Boruta and mRMR feature selectionmethods. Some features such as IFI44L in B cells, S100A8 in monocytes, and NCR2in natural killer cells are involved in the innate immune response of COVID-19.Other features such as ZFP36L2 in CD4(+) T cells can regulate the inflammatoryprocess of COVID-19. Subsequently, the IFS method was used to determine the best feature subsets and classifiers in the six immune cell types for twoclassification algorithms. Furthermore, we established the quantitative rulesused to distinguish the disease status. The results of this study can providetheoretical support for a more in-depth investigation of COVID-19 pathogenesisand intervention strategies.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of theCOVID-19 pandemic in women with non-malignant chronic pain, and to determinewhether women exposed to traumatic situations prior to the outbreak would be at ahigher risk of negative health impacts. Methods: A total of 365 women weredivided into three subgroups according to whether or not they had experienced atraumatic event prior to COVID-19. They completed an online survey. Results:Significant differences were found between groups during lockdown: 1) morepsychological abuse was experienced by the group of women who had experienced an interpersonal traumatic event prior to the pandemic than in the other subgroups; 2) physical activity levels were higher and scores on pain interference werelower in women in the non-traumatized subgroup than in the other subgroups; 3)pain interference was predicted by pain intensity, decreased social support, and resilience, whereas perceived well-being was predicted by pain interference.Conclusion: Women who had experienced a traumatic event prior to the pandemicsuffered worse consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly greater paininterference, although resilience was shown to both mitigate pain interferenceand enhance perceived well-being.

PG  - 241-252
LID - 10.2147/MDER.S370142 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Respiratory protective equipment is widely used in healthcare settingsto protect clinicians whilst treating patients with COVID-19. However, theirgeneric designs do not accommodate the variability in face shape across gendersand ethnicities. Accordingly, they are regularly overtightened to compensate for a poor fit. The present study aims at investigating the biomechanical and thermalloads during respirator application and the associated changes in local skinphysiology at the skin-device interface. Materials and Methods: Sixteen healthyvolunteers were recruited and reflected a range of gender, ethnicities and facialanthropometrics. Four single-use respirators were evaluated representingdifferent geometries, size and material interfaces. Participants were asked towear each respirator in a random order while a series of measurements wererecorded, including interface pressure, temperature and relative humidity.Measures of transepidermal water loss and skin hydration were assessed pre- andpost-respirator application, and after 20 minutes of recovery. Statisticalanalysis assessed differences between respirator designs and associations betweendemographics, interface conditions and parameters of skin health. Results:Results showed a statistically significant negative correlation (p < 0.05)between the alar width and interface pressures at the nasal bridge, for three of the respirator designs. The nasal bridge site also corresponded to the highestpressures for all respirator designs. Temperature and humidity significantlyincreased (p < 0.05) during each respirator application. Significant increases intransepidermal water loss values (p < 0.05) were observed after the applicationof the respirators in females, which were most apparent at the nasal bridge.Conclusion: The results revealed that specific facial features affected thedistribution of interface pressures and depending on the respirator design andmaterial, changes in skin barrier function were evident. The development ofrespirator designs that accommodate a diverse range of face shapes and protectthe end users from skin damage are required to support the long-term use of thesedevices.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered a transition towards telemedicine fordelivering outpatient care. The evidence base for telemedicine is heterogeneousand its efficacy remains debated. We, therefore, designed a mixed-methodssemi-structured survey to evaluate patients' and clinicians' experiences ofoutpatient telemedicine clinics during the pandemic. One-hundred and eighty-eightpatients and 69 clinicians from two hospitals in Gloucestershire completed thesurvey. The quantitative results for patients rated in-person and telemedicineappointments similarly in all areas except communication (p<0.001) and overallquality (p=0.004), both in favour of in-person consultations, while cliniciansrated all aspects of telemedicine appointments as inferior, with the exception ofconvenience (p=0.643). Qualitative analysis highlighted themes of communicationand relationship building difficulties, confidentiality concerns, loss of visual inspection as a clinical tool and debatable time efficiency associated withtelemedicine. Significant adaptation of current telemedicine services is requiredbefore it will be integrated into current practice.

LID - 10.7861/fhj.2022-0053 [doi]
AB  - The delivery of elective care needs to be reimagined to tackle the increasingdemand for services that is currently outstripping the available capacity; aproblem exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This articlehighlights key strategies to improve the delivery of elective care combined with local and national examples of best practice. It is based on key recommendations from the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) programme: the UK's largesthealthcare quality improvement programme operating across 42 clinicalspecialties. GIRFT has visited every integrated care system in England over thelast 12 months to discuss elective recovery and the learning from these visits iscaptured in this article. Rethinking the delivery of elective care, utilisingadvances in technology, and harnessing the power of data to identify unwarranted variation and targeted areas for improvement, will dramatically change the futuredelivery of elective care for the better.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused significant disruption to medical education,requiring those involved in its delivery to radically revise teaching programmes to ensure continuation of delivery of training to future healthcareprofessionals. We describe our experience of implementing an infection teachingprogramme on a COVID-19 ward at a London teaching hospital affiliated toUniversity College London (UCL) Medical School during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Weperformed a scoping literature review of all papers published on medicaleducation delivery in the pandemic between January 2020 - May 2021. We used theresults from this, along with our pre-existing knowledge of medical educationtheory, to summarise 10 key learning recommendations for planning medicaleducation in a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be the only significantinterruption to medical education we see in our lifetimes. We should developrobust and sustainable teaching programmes with the aim of reducing disruption inthe future.

AB  - The English NHS outpatient service was handling over 1.6 million referrals permonth before the COVID-19 pandemic, with numbers growing each year. There was afall during the pandemic but by 2022, referrals were close to pre-pandemiclevels. The GIRFT programme clinical leads from over 41 specialties visited each English hospital to identify unwarranted variation in care and identify goodpractice. A wealth of innovations covering the whole outpatient journey wereidentified in the national reports, which are published on the GIRFT website.Patient needs and demands vary greatly between infants and the elderly, betweenmental health, medical and surgical specialties. However, it was remarkable howcommon themes bridged age and illness to identify again and again how servicescould be improved. This report summarises the key themes identified by GIRFT toimprove outpatient services in England as it moves forwards from the COVIDpandemic.

AB  - Diagnostic capacity in the NHS in England was much lower than that in many other developed countries before the COVID-19 pandemic. The relative lack of diagnosticequipment and workforce is now hampering recovery from the pandemic. In response to this, a major programme of work is now underway to improve access to a widerange of diagnostic tests. Establishment of community diagnostic centres is a keycomponent of this programme.

AB  - The National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) Research and Development Survey(RANDS) is a series of commercial panel surveys collected for methodologicalresearch purposes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, NCHS expanded the use ofRANDS to rapidly monitor aspects of the public health emergency. The RANDS duringCOVID-19 survey was designed to include COVID-19 related health outcome andcognitive probe questions. Rounds 1 and 2 were fielded June 9-July 6, 2020 andAugust 3-20, 2020 using the AmeriSpeak(R) Panel. Existing and new approaches wereused to: 1) evaluate question interpretation and performance to improve futureCOVID-19 data collections and 2) to produce a set of experimental estimates forpublic release using weights which were calibrated to NCHS' National HealthInterview Survey (NHIS) to adjust for potential bias in the panel. Through theexpansion of the RANDS platform and ongoing methodological research, NCHSreported timely information about COVID-19 in the United States and demonstrated the use of recruited panels for reporting national health statistics. This reportdescribes the use of RANDS for reporting on the pandemic and the associatedmethodological survey design decisions including the adaptation of questionevaluation approaches and calibration of panel weights.

AB  - Although the FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) for some antiviraldrugs for the treatment of COVID-19, no direct antiviral drugs have beenidentified for the treatment of critically ill patients, the most importanttreatment is suppression of the hyperinflammation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of corticosteroids in hospitalized severe or criticalpatients positive for COVID-19. This is a retrospective single-center descriptivestudy. Patients classified as having severe or critical COVID-19 infections with acute respiratory dysfunction syndrome in Shenzhen Third People's Hospital wereenrolled from January 11th to March 30th, 2020. Ninety patients were classifiedas having severe or critical COVID-19 infections. The patients were treated with methylprednisolone with a low-to-moderate dosage and short duration. The daysfrom the symptom onset to methylprednisolone were about 8 days. Eighteen patientswere treated with invasive ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) care. Allthe patients in the severe group and ten in the critical group recovered and weredischarged. Three critical cases with invasive ventilation died. Although caseswere much more severe in the corticosteroid-treated group, the mortality was not significantly increased. Early use of low-to-moderate dosage and short durationof corticosteroid may be the more accurate immune-modulatory treatment and bringsmore benefits to severe patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whichcauses coronavirus disease- 2019 (COVID-19), has been a global epidemic in ourhealthcare system. SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, butneurological involvement has also been reported, including Guillain-Barresyndrome (GBS) development. Case Presentation: A 58-year-old male with knownco-morbid hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergencyroom with complaints of worsening shortness of breath, dry cough, and fever forthe past 10 days. On day 20 of hospitalization, he developed neurologicalsymptoms after being tested positive for COVID-19. A neuroelectrophysiology studywas conducted to evaluate neurological symptoms and suggested that the patientsuffers from acute motor-sensory axonal polyneuropathy (AMSAN). CSF analysisshowed elevated protein levels that confirmed the diagnosis of GBS. He wassubsequently treated with oral prednisolone and IVIG, which improved neurologicalsymptoms. Conclusion: Ever since the emergence of COVID-19, GBS has surfaced asto its potentially dangerous outcome. Healthcare professionals should be mindful of GBS and should rule it out in anyone having sensory symptoms or weaknessduring or after a COVID-19 infection. Its early detection and treatment canresult in improved clinical outcomes.

PG  - 936141
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.936141 [doi]
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy represents a novel anticancer strategy that acts directly onthe immune system, promoting its activation toward cancer cells to enhance itsnatural ability to fight cancer. Among various treatments currently used orinvestigated, chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T-cell therapy and immunecheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have consistently proven their efficacy. Theseinnovations are progressively improving the standard of care in cancer treatment,yet they are hampered by novel neurological adverse events, attributing toneurologists a key role in the multidisciplinary oncological team. Indeed,neurotoxicity may develop in up to 77% of patients who received CAR T-celltherapy and usually presents with encephalopathy characterized by a predominantfrontal lobe dysfunction. This neurotoxicity is related to cytokine releasesyndrome, a systemic hyperinflammatory condition triggered by CAR T-cells. On theother hand, following treatment with ICIs, unrestrained T-cells may lead tocentral and peripheral neurological disorders by antigen-directed autoimmunity.Notably, biological and clinical similarities have been underlined betweenneurotoxicity related to CAR T-cell therapy and neurological manifestations ofcytokine storms (e.g. COVID-19-related encephalopathy), as well as between asubgroup of ICI-related neurological adverse events and paraneoplasticneurological syndromes. Therefore, these cancer immunotherapy-relatedneurological syndromes may provide an unprecedented, perhaps transitory,opportunity to shed light on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of a widespectrum of neurological syndromes and to push forward our knowledge inneuroimmunology.

AB  - Objective: To assess veterinary needs of clients with low socioeconomic statusduring the COVID-19 pandemic, to explore the impact of the pandemic onmarginalized communities, and to understand perceptions regarding barriers andincentives of telehealth appointments as a method to increase care access.Sample: 205 active Community Veterinary Medicine Clinic clients at Tufts at Tech Community Veterinary Clinic in Worcester, MA. Procedures: This cross-sectionalstudy used a survey-based method to assess veterinary needs of clients with lowsocioeconomic status during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey measured clientperceptions regarding potential barriers and incentives of telehealthappointments. Participants were randomly sampled from a list of active clientsand completed the survey either by email or over the phone. The survey wasavailable in both English and Spanish. Clients who completed the questionnairereceived credit for a free examination. Results: A total of 205 clients submittedsurvey responses. Factors affecting access to veterinary care were impacted bythe COVID-19 pandemic. Access to reliable internet in the home was reported by87% (n = 177) of participants. Digital access was correlated with education when controlling for race, income, age, and gender. Education was predictive ofcomfort with using video-chat (chi(2) = 65, df = 24, p </= 0.01) and of whetheror not clients reported need for assistance for using video-chat (chi(2) = 52, df= 18, p </= 0.01). Patient education level was significantly predictive ofwanting to use telehealth for at least one type of appointment (p </= 0.05).Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: The findings indicate that implementingtelehealth services at this Community Medicine Clinic is feasible for much of theactive clientele and offers a new avenue to provide veterinary care during times of social distancing restrictions and beyond.

TI  - Cytokine Profile in Children with Severe Multisystem Inflammatory SyndromeRelated to the Coronavirus Disease 2019.
PG  - 259-264

AB  - The multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel andconcerning entity related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although MIS-C has been the subject of intensive researchefforts, its pathophysiology and optimal treatment remain elusive. We studied theclinical features, laboratory findings, and immunoinflammatory profiles of seven children prospectively admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) during the first wave of the pandemic. All patients had immunoglobulin (Ig)-G againstSARS-CoV-2, four of seven patients had both IgM and IgG, and in one of the 7SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a respiratory sample. All patients receivedintravenous fluid boluses (median: 15 mL/kg) and norepinephrine. The most common form of respiratory support was supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. None ofthe patients needed mechanical ventilation. The cardiovascular system wasfrequently involved. All patients had an elevated troponin-I (median: 107.3ng/L). Four out of seven patients had coronary artery abnormalities, and two ofseven had both abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) findings and evidence of leftventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram. Ig levels and complement function werenormal. Peripheral blood phenotyping with flow cytometry showed decreased T-cell numbers at the expense of CD8+ T-cells. Cytokine profiling showed a heterogeneousincrease in interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon(IFN)-gamma, IL-18, IL-2Ra, IL-10, and IL-1Ra that tended to normalize aftertreatment. Our study shows that children with MIS-C have elevated plasma levelsof pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the acute phase of the disease withoutother relevant immunologic disturbances. These findings suggest the presence of amixed antagonist response syndrome (MARS) similar to that present in pediatricsepsis. Combining a meticulous differential diagnosis with cautiously coordinatedimmunomodulatory therapy and high-quality supportive care can help cliniciansavoid causing iatrogenic harm in patients with MIS-C.

AB  - Intravenous pumps provide essential, life-sustaining medications to patients.Pumps must be in working order and available on short notice to be effective. We identified inefficiencies in our pump management process that inflated the costand time to complete repairs. Methods: Our multidisciplinary team completed a60-day before-after trial that followed the Toyota Production System Leanmethodology and evaluated the sustainability of our improvements for thefollowing 48 months. We used value stream mapping and manual time studies toidentify areas for improvement. Device turnaround time (TAT) was the number ofdays from receiving a device for repair to its return to service. Interventionsincluded: establishing a reliable system to receive and track repair requests,creating a better organized, more efficient workroom, streamlining the inventory of repair parts, and tracking delivery systems reliably. Results: We reduced meanintravenous pump TAT by 89% and sustained TAT at 74%-97% below baseline for 4years, including during the COVID pandemic. Conclusions: We used Lean methodologyto create a system to receive, track, and provide safe, functional equipment toproviders promptly. Both clinical and nonclinical healthcare professionals canuse Lean to produce a sustainable improved system.

TI  - COVID-19 related distress and sleep health among trauma-exposed South Asians:Does generational status matter?
LID - 10.1002/smi.3184 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial changes in individual andsocio-economic factors that may negatively impact sleep health. We examinedassociations between COVID-19 related distress and sleep among trauma-exposedSouth Asian adults in the United States. Since a health advantage amongforeign-born individuals has been previously noted in the literature (the"immigrant paradox"), we also explored if generational status (number ofgenerations one's family has been in the U.S.) moderated associations betweenCOVID-19 related distress and sleep health. Participants were 196 trauma-exposed South Asian adults residing in the U.S. (54% male, 63% U.S.-born citizens,average age = 34.51 years), who completed measures of generational status,COVID-19 related distress, trauma exposure, sleep-related impairment, and sleepdisturbances. Greater COVID-19 distress was associated with more sleepdisturbances (b = 0.15, p < .001) and sleep-related impairment (b = 0.24, p <.001). Generational status was not associated with sleep, nor did it modifyassociations between COVID-19 distress and sleep. Findings highlight thepotential importance of developing interventions to reduce stress and sleepdifficulties during the pandemic. Our results did not support the immigrationparadox. Future studies are needed to better understand the role of generational status on sleep health across immigrant subgroups. This article is protected bycopyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic revealed a myriad ofpostinfectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)sequelae, many of which remain poorly understood. We describe a rare presentationof a patient developing 2 simultaneous COVID-19 sequelae: transverse myelitis andacquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS). There have been numerous published case reports of patients developing transverse myelitis after a diagnosis of COVID-19.However, none have described AVWS as an observed complication from SARS-CoV-2infection. To our knowledge, this case report is the first to describe AVWS as a result of COVID-19 infection, suggesting that patients with a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 are susceptible to developing this rare bleeding disorder.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding molecularpathogenesis is an essential factor for the allocation of effective preventivemeasures and the development of targeted therapeutics against COVID-19. Thegenome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes structural and nonstructural proteins, which can be targets for compounds with potential therapeutic ability. On the other hand, the virus life cycle has stages susceptible to targeting by drug compounds. Manynatural antiviral compounds have been studied and evaluated at the cellular andmolecular levels with antiviral potential. Meanwhile, many studies over the past few months have shown that plant polysaccharides have good ability to targetproteins and stages of the virus life cycle. In this regard, in this reviewstudy, the virus specifications and infectious process and structural andfunctional components of SARS-CoV-2 will be reviewed, and then the latest studieson the effect of plant compounds with more focus on polysaccharides on viraltargets and their inhibitory potential on the infectious process of COVID-19 willbe discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic determines the functioning of the healthcaresystem. The epidemic of HIV infection depends heavily on the effectiveness of thehealth system and its ability to test and deliver prevention and treatment.Thisstudy aims to determine the consequences of this pandemic on the development ofHIV infection testing in the Czech Republic. METHODS: A descriptivecross-sectional study analyzed data for two infectious diseases, HIV (2020 and2015-2019) and COVID-19 (2020), in the Czech Republic. For the statisticalcomparison of 2020 with the earlier period, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) andPoisson regression methods were used. Monthly HIV and COVID-19 indicators for2020 were analyzed using correlation analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Asignificant difference was observed only in April (IRR = 0.81; p = 0.046) andJuly (IRR = 1.27; p = 0.023) between the number of HIV tests performed in eachmonth in 2020 and the control period (average for the same months of the period2015-2019).Significant differences between the observed periods were furtheridentified for testing reasons. Correlation analysis of the number of testsperformed on HIV and COVID-19 after 2020 showed a negative relationship (r =-0.261, p = 0.412). CONCLUSION: The study did not confirm statisticallysignificant differences between the number of HIV tests performed in the pandemicyear 2020 compared to the previous period, except for two months. The incidenceand number of newly diagnosed cases did not differ statistically significantlyfrom previous years (2015-2019).

TI  - Efficacy of Sinopharm Vaccine among Stem Cell Transplant Recipient during twopeaks of Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19.
LID - 10.2174/1574886317666220801122822 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the dearth of research on the complications of Sinopharm coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in the immunocompromised individuals and the lack of available data on COVID-19 vaccination from Iran. OBJECTIVE: Thisstudy aimed to investigate the efficacy of vaccine of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine and its complications in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. METHODS: Thiswas a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 250 patients with BMT who were referred to Montaserieh Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. Among them 53 case who received at least two doses of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine from March to January2021 were entered in this study. The data were extracted from a studentdissertation (Code:4000370). RESULTS: Sinopharm vaccine side effects werereported only in 7.7% of the patients, and Shingles was the only serious sideeffect of the Sinopharm vaccine, which was observed only in one case. The resultsalso revealed that Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine side effects were not related toage or gender. Infection with Delta variant of COVID-19 was reported in 7.5%(n=4) and no mortality was reported among them. Vaccine failure was reported in39.6% of the cases; however, no mortality was reported among patients infectedwith the Omicron variant of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In summary, it seems thatSinopharm COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects were not serious among stem celltransplant recipients. However, it may lead to some severe complications in thepopulation. Vaccine failure against the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19has been reported among more than one-third of BMT patients; however, nomortality was observed among BMT patients infected with the new variants ofCOVID-19.

TI  - Next-generation sequencing for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance andpathogenicity in municipal wastewater treatment plants.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220802093415 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks antimicrobial resistance (AMR) andvarious pathogens among the top 10 health threats. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of human deaths due to AMR will reach 10 million annually. On theother hand, several infectious outbreaks such as SARS, H1N1 influenza, Ebola,Zika fever, and COVID-19 have severely affected human populations worldwide inthe last 20 years. These recent global diseases have generated the need tomonitor outbreaks of pathogens and AMR to establish effective public healthstrategies. This review presents AMR and pathogenicity associated with wastewatertreatment plants (WWTP), focusing on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) monitoring as a complementary system to clinical surveillance. In this regard, WWTP may bemonitored at three main points. First, at the inlet (raw wastewater or influent) to identify a broad spectrum of AMR and pathogens contained in the excretions of residents served by sewer networks, with a specific spatio-temporal location.Second, at the effluent, to ensure the elimination of AMR and pathogens in thetreated water, considering the rising demand for safe wastewater reuse. Third, insewage sludge or biosolids, since their beneficial use or final disposal canrepresent a significant risk to public health. This review is divided into twosections to address the importance and implications of AMR and pathogensurveillance in wastewater and WWTP, based on NGS. The first section presents thefundamentals of surveillance techniques applied in WWTP (metataxonomics,metagenomics, functional metagenomics, metaviromics, and metatranscriptomics).Their scope and limitations are analyzed to show how microbiological and qPCRtechniques complement NGS surveillance, overcoming its limitations. The secondsection discusses the contribution of 36 NGS research papers on WWTPsurveillance, highlighting the current situation and perspectives. In bothsections, research challenges and opportunities are presented.

AB  - Drug discovery and development are critical processes that enable the treatmentof a wide variety of health-related problems. These are time-consuming, tedious, complicated, and costly processes. Numerous difficulties arise throughout theentire process of drug discovery, from design to testing. Corona Virus Disease2019 (COVID-19) recently posed a significant threat to global public health.SARS-Cov-2 and its variants are rapidly spreading in humans due to their hightransmission rate. To effectively treat COVID-19, potential drugs and vaccinesmust be developed quickly. The advancement of artificial intelligence has shiftedthe focus of drug development away from traditional methods and towardbioinformatics tools. Computer-aided drug design techniques have demonstratedtremendous utility in dealing with massive amounts of biological data anddeveloping efficient algorithms. Artificial intelligence enables more effectiveapproaches to complex problems associated with drug discovery and developmentthrough the use of machine learning. Artificial intelligence-based technologiesimprove the pharmaceutical industry's ability to discover effective drugs. Thisreview summarizes significant challenges encountered during the drug discoveryand development processes, as well as the applications of artificialintelligence-based methods to overcome those obstacles in order to provideeffective solutions to health problems. This may provide additional insight into the mechanism of action, resulting in the development of vaccines and potentsubstitutes for repurposed drugs that can be used to treat not only COVID-19 but also other ailments.

TI  - Primary SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia Screening in Adults: Analysis of the Correlationbetween High-Resolution Computed Tomography Pulmonary Patterns and Initial OxygenSaturation Levels.
LID - 10.2174/1573405618666220802095119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is mandatory forpatients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) infection and a high respiratory rate (RR) because sublobarconsolidation is the likely pathological pattern in addition to ground glassopacities (GGOs). OBJECTIVE: The present study determined the correlation betweenthe percentage extent of typical pulmonary lesions on HRCT, as a representationof severity, and the RR and peripheral oxygen saturation level (SpO2), asmeasured through pulse oximetry, in patients with reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed primary (noncomplicated) SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: The present retrospective study was conducted in 332 adultpatients who presented withzdyspnea and hypoxemia and were admitted to PrinceMohammed bin Abdulaziz Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between May 15, 2020 andDecember 15, 2020. All the patients underwent chest HRCT. Of the total, 198patients with primary noncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were finally selectedbased on the typical chest HRCT patterns. The main CT patterns, GGO and sublobar consolidation, were individually quantified as a percentage of the totalpulmonary involvement through algebraic summation of the percentage of the 19pulmonary segments affected. Additionally, the statistical correlation strengthbetween the total percentage pulmonary involvement and the age, initial RR, andpercentage SpO2 of the patients was determined. RESULTS: The mean +/- standarddeviation (SD) age of the 198 patients was 48.9 +/- 11.4 years. GGO magnitudealone exhibited a significant weak positive correlation with patients' age (r =0.2; p = 0.04). Sublobar consolidation extent exhibited a relatively strongerpositive correlation with RR than GGO magnitude (r = 0.23; p = 0.002). Arelatively stronger negative correlation was observed between the GGO extent and SpO2 (r = - 0.38; p = 0.002) than that between sublobar consolidation and SpO2 (r= - 0.2; p = 0.04). An increase in the correlation strength was demonstrated withincreased case segregation with GGO extent (r = - 0.34; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION:The correlation between the magnitudes of typical pulmonary lesion patterns,particularly GGO, which exhibited an incremental correlation pattern on chestHRCT, and the SpO2 percentage, may allow the establishment of an artificialintelligence program to differentiate primary SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from othercomplications and associated pathology influencing SpO2.

LID - 10.2174/1871530322666220801102402 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a severe acute respiratorydistress syndrome, coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to acute tissueinjury and an overstated immune response. In COVID-19, there are noteworthychanges in the fibrinolytic system with the development of coagulopathy.Therefore, modulation of the fibrinolytic system may affect the course ofCOVID-19. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic drug that reduces theconversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which is necessary for SARS-CoV-2infectivity. In addition, TXA has anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, andanti-thrombotic effects, which may attenuate the COVID-19 severity. Thus, in thisnarrative review, we try to find the beneficial and harmful effects of TXA inCOVID-19.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. (OFI) is a plant with numerous beneficialproperties known in traditional medicine. It has been a domesticated plant inLatin America, Africa, Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, India andAustralia. Nowadays, the research concentrates his efforts on natural compoundsto lower cost and the possible side effects exerted by synthetic compounds. Theuse of nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds of vegetable origin with importantnutritional values, is encouraged. OFI has shown numerous activities due to itshigh content of antioxidants, including flavonoids and ascorbate, pigments,including carotenoids and betalains, phenolic acids and other phytochemicalcomponents, such as biopeptides and soluble fibers. The most important effectsexerted by OFI are represented by the activity against acne, arthrosis,dermatosis, diabetes, diarrhea, fever, high blood pressure, prostatosis,rheumatism, stomachache, tumor, wart, allergy, wound, colitis and some viraldiseases. Moreover, a promising role has been suggested in inflammatory boweldisease, colitis and metabolic syndrome. The most recent studies were addressedto the role of OFI for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease. In thelight of the above, in this review the biological activities and health benefits that this plant may exert are summarized.

TI  - Surveillance on Adverse Events Following COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccinationin Goa, India: An observational study.
LID - 10.2174/1574886317666220803104438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVISHIELD, ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine was grantedemergency use authorization (EUA) as the first vaccine in India in January 2021. Knowing what to anticipate after vaccination will reduce vaccine hesitancy in thepublic. This study aimed to identify and measure the adverse events followingCOVID-19 vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observationalstudy was conducted at Goa Medical College, starting on February 21 till May 23, 2021. A total of 418 people were enrolled. We collected the data using theMicrosoft Form and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and R-program. RESULTS: Of the 418 vaccine recipients, the incidence rate of AEFI (Adverse Events FollowingImmunization) was 54.31%. Fever, fatigue, and headache were the most commonlyreported systemic AEFIs. Among these, 54.7% of AEFI were mild, 42.38% were of themoderate category, and only 2.96% were of grade 3 severity. None of the AEFIswere severe enough for hospitalization. Most of them developed symptoms within 24hours of the first dose. Complete recovery from AEFIs took a median time of 24hours. CONCLUSION: Most of our study findings were consistent with the phase 1,2/3 trials findings of Oxford-AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 vaccine. The AEFI symptomswere considered immune reactions to the vaccine. The AEFIs were more common amongyounger individuals and females. The chance of missing a serious adverse eventlike a thromboembolic phenomenon cannot be ruled out. We observed low AEFI rates with COVISHIELD in the Indian population compared to Oxford-AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1vaccine in the UK-based population, which can be explained by pre-existingimmunity against adenovirus in the Indian population. However, based on the studyfindings, we may interpret that the COVISHIELD, Serum Institute of India, carriesa good safety profile overall.

LID - 10.2174/1573405618666220803123626 [doi]
AB  - The deep learning is a prominent method for automatic detection of COVID-19disease using medical dataset. This paper aims to give the perspective on thedata insufficiency issue that exists in COVID-19 detection associated with deeplearning. The extensive study on the available datasets comprising CT and X-rayimages are presented in this paper, which can be very much useful in the context of deep learning framework for COVID-19 detection. Moreover, various datahandling techniques that are very essential in deep learning models are discussedin detail. Advanced data handling techniques and approaches to modify deeplearning models are suggested to handle the data insufficiency problem in deeplearning based COVID-19 detection.

TI  - Impact of different COVID-19 waves on kidney replacement therapy epidemiology andmortality: REMER 2020.
LID - gfac234 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfac234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) confers the highest risk of deathfrom COVID-19. However, most data refer to the early pandemic waves. Whole yearanalysis in comparison with prior secular trends are scarce. METHODS: We present the 2020 REMER Madrid KRT registry, corresponding to the Spanish Region hardesthit by COVID-19. RESULTS: In 2020, KRT incidence decreased 12% versus 2019 while KRT prevalence decreased (-1.75%) for the first time since records began and the number of kidney transplants (KT) decreased by 16%. Mortality on KRT was 10.2%(34% higher than the mean for 2008-2019). The 2019 to 2020 increase in mortality was larger for KT (+68%) than for HD (+24%) or PD (+38%). The most common causeof death was infection (n = 419, 48% of deaths), followed by cardiovascular (200,23%). Deaths from infection increased by 167% year over year and accounted for95% of excess deaths in 2020 over 2019. COVID-19 was the most common cause ofdeath (68% of infection deaths, 33% of total deaths). The bulk of COVID-19 deaths(209/285, 73%) occurred during the first COVID-19 wave, which roughly accountedfor the increased mortality in 2020. Being a KT recipient was an independent riskfactor for COVID-19 death. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 negatively impacted theincidence and prevalence of KRT, but the increase in KRT deaths was localized to the first wave of the pandemic. The increased annual mortality argues againstCOVID-19 accelerating death of patients with short life expectancy and thetemporal pattern of COVID-19 mortality suggests that appropriate healthcare mayimprove outcomes.

TI  - Boredom belief moderates the mental health impact of boredom among young people: Correlational and multi-wave longitudinal evidence gathered during the COVID-19pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/jopy.12764 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Young people's experience of boredom and its psychological healthsequelae have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The present studyexamined the moderating role of boredom beliefs-the extent to which oneaffectively dislikes boredom (boredom dislike) and cognitively accepts it(boredom normalcy)-on the association between boredom experience and mentalwell-being. We also validated a new measure of boredom beliefs in two differentsamples of young people. METHOD: We report data from a correlational study withBritish young people aged 12-25 (Study 1; N = 2,495) and a 16-week eight-wavewithin-subject study with Israeli adolescents aged 12-18 (Study 2; N = 314).RESULTS: Across both studies, disliking boredom was associated with higherfrequency and intensity of boredom. Boredom dislike moderated the negativeassociation between boredom and mental well-being, such that the association was more salient among those who strongly disliked boredom. Normalizing boredom waspositively associated with mental well-being. The measure of boredom beliefsdemonstrated fair validity and reliability. CONCLUSION: Results provide novelinsights into the potential buffering effect of boredom beliefs against themental health impact of boredom, particularly at a time of reduced activity.These findings generalize across two different countries.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of patient self-collected oral swab (tongue and cheek) in comparison to health-care worker collected nasopharyngeal swab for Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 detection.
LID - 10.1111/apm.13266 [doi]
AB  - The present study was conducted to compare the performance of patientself-collected oral swab (OS) with healthcare worker (HCW) collectednasopharyngeal swab (NPS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in real world setting. Paired OS and NPS were collected from 485 consecutive individuals presenting with symptoms ofcoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) or asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 cases.Both specimens were processed for RT-PCR and cycle threshold (Ct) value for each test was obtained. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement(NPA), overall percent agreement (OPA) and kappa were calculated for OS RT-PCRcompared to NPS RT-PCR as reference. A total of 116/485 (23.9%) participants werepositive by NPS RT-PCR. OS had PPA of 71.6%, NPA of 98.8%, OPA of 92.4% and kappaof 0.771. Almost all participants (483/485, 99.6%) reported OS as a convenientand comfortable sample for SARS-CoV-2 testing over NPS. All participants with Ct values <25 and majority (90.8%) with Ct values <30 were detected by OS. Toconclude, OS self-sampling was preferred in comparison to NPS due the ease andcomfort during collection. The performance of OS RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 detection,however, was sub-optimal in comparison to NPS RT-PCR.

TI  - Challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Obstetrics and Gynecologyresidency program: a mixed-methods Swedish survey in the COPE Staff cohort study.
PG  - 602

AB  - BACKGROUND: To outline how the training program and work situation of residentsin Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB-GYN) was affected by the pandemic and toilluminate how residents experienced these changes. METHODS: As part of theCOVID-19 in Pregnancy and Early Childhood Staff (COPE Staff) cohort study,between January and May 2021, all participating residents were invited to answer a 28-question online Resident Survey focusing on their specialist education, worksituation and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statisticswere given in percentages for categorical variables and means and standarddeviations (SD) for continuous variables. Univariate comparative analyses wereperformed with the use of the Pearson's Chi-2-test for dichotomous data. Theassociation between residents' worry about the quality and length of theirspecialist training, with extra clinical hours and transfer to other healthcareinstitutions were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Free textresponses were analyzed by content analysis. RESULTS: Of the 162 participatingOB-GYN residents, 69% expressed concern that the pandemic would have a negativeimpact on their training. Ninety-five (95%) reported cancellation/postponement ofeducational activities, 70% performed fewer surgeries and 27% had beentransferred to other healthcare institutions where about half reported havinggained more general knowledge as a physician. Working extra clinical hours wasreported by 69% (7.4 +/- 5.3 hours per week) and 14% had considered changingtheir profession due to the pandemic. Senior residents, compared to juniorresidents, more often experienced cancelled/postponed clinical rotations (30% vs 15%, P=0.02) and reported performing fewer surgeries (P=0.02). The qualitativeanalysis highlighted the lack of surgical procedural training as a major concern for residents. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly impacted thetraining program and work situation of OB-GYN residents in Sweden. Residents wereconcerned over the negative impact of the pandemic on their training program and senior residents reported more missed educational opportunities as compared tojunior residents. Program directors, head of institutions and clinicalsupervisors can use the problem areas pinpointed by this study to supportresidents and compensate for missed educational opportunities. Whilehands-on-training and operating time cannot be compensated for, the authors hope that the findings of the study can help develop new strategies to minimize thenegative impact of the current and future pandemics on resident education andwork situation.

TI  - Impact of antimalarial resistance and COVID-19 pandemic on malaria care amongpregnant women in Northern Uganda (ERASE): protocol of a prospectiveobservational study.
PG  - 668
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07645-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uganda accounts for 5% of all malaria cases and deaths reportedglobally and, in endemic countries, pregnancy is a risk factor for bothacquisition of P. falciparum infection and development of severe malaria. Inrecent years, malaria control has been threatened by COVID-19 pandemic and by theemergence, in Northern Uganda, of both resistance to artemisinin derivatives and to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. METHODS: In this facility-based, prospective,observational study, pregnant women will be recruited at antenatal-care visitsand followed-up until delivery. Collected data will explore the incidence ofasymptomatic parasitemia and malaria-related outcomes, as well as the attitudestowards malaria prevention, administration of intermittent preventive treatment, healthcare seeking behavior and use of insecticide-treated nets. A subpopulation of women diagnosed with malaria will be recruited and their blood samples will beanalyzed for detection of genetic markers of resistance to artemisininderivatives and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Also, to investigate the impact ofCOVID-19 on malaria care among pregnant women, a retrospective, interrupted-time series will be conducted on at the study sites for the period January 2018 toDecember 2021. DISCUSSION: The present study will explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on incidence of malaria and malaria-related adverse outcomes, along withthe prevalence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives and tosulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. To our knowledge, this is the first study aiming toexplore the combined effect of these factors on a cohort of pregnant women. TRIALREGISTRATION: This study has been registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov publicwebsite on 26th April, 2022. CLINICALTRIALS: gov Identifier: NCT05348746.

PG  - 528
LID - 10.1186/s12888-022-04148-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have previously compared the prevalence or sample means of distress and mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19pandemic, while results on changes at the individual-level, and regardingmultiple outcome measures are demanded. METHODS: This online study investigatedindividual changes in stress and mental health from before the COVID-19 pandemic to the first lockdown in adults from Southeastern Germany. This region wasselected as it was where SARS-CoV-2 was first documented in Germany, and also dueto the implementation of strict stay-at-home orders and social contactprohibitions. From April 10-27, 2020, we collected state measures and theirclinical relevance for the subareas of perceived stress: worries, tension, joy,and demands. We also collected information regarding the following mental health problems: depression, anxiety, pathological worry, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and health anxiety; as well as retrospective measures of how participantsfelt they have changed in comparison to before the pandemic, ranging from worseto better. RESULTS: The analytical sample comprised 396 adult participants. Onaverage, participants experienced increases in worries, tension, and lack of joy,and increases in mental health problems, but a decrease in demands. Perceivedincreases in symptoms of depression (26.0%) and PTSD (25.5%) were significantlymore frequent than in symptoms of anxiety (particularly acute fear and panic)(5.6%), pathological worry (9.8%), and health anxiety (7.3%) (ps<.001). One per10 participants (10.4%) reported an increase in depressive symptoms, and nearlytwo per 10 (18.4%) an increase in PTSD symptoms and additionally showed aclinically relevant symptom strain during lockdown. Interestingly, mainlynon-specific PTSD symptoms associated with a general stress reaction wereexperienced to be increased. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a dissociation ofperceived changes in subareas of stress and mental health with a particularexperience of increases in depressive and general stress symptoms and a decrease in external demands. This points to a need for a more differentiated view on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress and mental health, and for targetedinterventions for mental health problems arising frequently during the pandemic.

TI  - The effect of intra-nasal tetra sodium pyrophosphate on decreasing elevated nasalcalcium and improving olfactory function post COVID-19: a randomized controlledtrial.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s13223-022-00711-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is recognized as a symptom of COVID-19. Reportsrevealed the nasal calcium increase has adverse effects on olfactory function.Tetra sodium pyrophosphate, a chelating agent, can bind calcium and help improve olfaction. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with olfactory dysfunction persisting formore than 90 days after COVID-19 were recruited. Participants were divided into 2groups that received either 0.9% sodium chloride or 1% tetra sodium pyrophosphatefor topical application. Olfactory function was tested with the Sniffin' Stickstest before treatment and 1 month later. In addition, nasal calcium wasdetermined with an ion-selective electrode. RESULTS: After topical application oftetra sodium pyrophosphate compared to sodium chloride, improvement from anosmia to hyposmia with decrease in calcium level was demonstrated. As for the resultsof tetra-sodium pyrophosphate, 81% showed improved olfactory function and 19% didnot exhibit olfaction improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal application of tetrasodium pyrophosphate may be associated with improvement in olfactory functionafter COVID -19 infection. Trial registration Ethical Committee of DamiettaFaculty of Medicine approved this study on January 2021 (approval number, IRB00012367-21-03-010).

TI  - Quality of the diet during the COVID-19 pandemic in 11 Latin-American countries.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/s41043-022-00316-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The confinement by COVID-19 has affected the foodchain and environments, which added to factors such as anxiety, frustration, fearand stress have modified the quality of the diet in the population around theworld. The purpose of this study was to explore diet quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in 11 Latin American countries. METHODOLOGY: Multicentric,cross-sectional study. An online survey was applied to residents of 11Latin-American countries, during April and May 2020, when confinement wasmandatory. Diet quality was evaluated using a validated questionnaire. RESULT:10,573 people participated in the study. The quality of the food by country showsthat Colombia presented the best quality, while Chile and Paraguay presented the lowest. When comparing the overall results of diet quality by gender, schoolingand age, women, people with more schooling and people under 30 years of age,presented better diet quality. The regression model showed that the variablesassociated with diet quality were: age (df = 3, F = 4. 57, p < 0.001), sex (df = 1, F = 131.01, p < 0.001), level of education (df = 1, F = 38.29, p < 0.001),perception of weight change (df = 2, F = 135.31, p < 0.001), basis services (df =1, F = 8.63, p = 0.003), and quarantine (df = 1, F = 12.14, p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: It is necessary for governments to intervene to reverse theseindicators, considering that inadequate feeding favors the appearance of nocommunicable diseases, which favor a higher risk of infection and worse prognosiswith COVID-19.

PG  - 180
LID - 10.1186/s13690-022-00933-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the fourth COVID-19 wave in Japan, marked differences becameapparent in the scale of the epidemic between metropolitan Tokyo in eastern Japanand Osaka prefecture in western Japan. METHODS: Public epidemic data wereanalyzed, with performance of mathematical simulations using simplified SEIRmodels. RESULTS: The increase in the number of infected persons per 100,000population during the fourth wave of expansion was greater in Osaka than inTokyo. The basic reproduction number in Osaka was greater than in Tokyo.Particularly, the number of infected people in their 20 s increased during thefourth wave: The generation-specific reproduction number for people in their 20 swas higher than for people of other generations. Both Tokyo and Osaka were found to have strong correlation between the increase in the number of infected people and the average number of people using the main downtown stations at night.Simulations showed vaccination of people in their 60 s and older reduced thenumber of infected people among the high-risk elderly population in the fourthwave. However, age-specific vaccination of people in their 20 s reduced thenumber of infected people more than vaccination of people in their 60 s andolder. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the epidemic between Tokyo and Osaka areexplainable by different behaviors of the most socially active generation. Whenvaccine supplies are adequate, priority should be assigned to high-risk olderadults, but if vaccine supplies are scarce, simulation results suggestconsideration of vaccinating specific groups among whom the epidemic is spreadingrapidly.

TI  - 2-deoxy-D-glucose as an adjunct to standard of care in the medical management of COVID-19: a proof-of-concept and dose-ranging randomised phase II clinical trial.
PG  - 669
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07642-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, no single efficacious therapeutic exists for acuteCOVID-19 management and a multimodal approach may be necessary. 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2-DG) is a metabolic inhibitor that has been shown to limit multiplication ofSARS-CoV-2 in-vitro. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2-DG as adjunct tostandard care in the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase II, clinical study to evaluate theefficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2-DG administered as adjunct to standard ofcare (SOC). A total of 110 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years withmoderate to severe COVID-19 were included. Patients were randomized to receive63, 90, or 126 mg/kg/day 2-DG in addition to SOC or SOC only. Times tomaintaining SpO2 >/= 94% on room air, discharge, clinical recovery, vital signsnormalisation, improvement by 1 and 2 points on WHO clinical progression scale,negative conversion on RT-PCR, requirement for intensive care, and mortality wereanalyzed to assess the efficacy. RESULTS: Patients treated with 90 mg/kg/day 2-DGplus SOC showed better outcomes. Time to maintaining SpO2 >/= 94% wassignificantly shorter in the 2-DG 90 mg compared to SOC (median 2.5 days vs. 5days, Hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 2.3 [1.14, 4.64], p = 0.0201).Times to discharge from isolation ward, to clinical recovery, and to vital signs normalization were significantly shorter for the 2-DG 90 mg group. All threedoses of 2-DG were well tolerated. Thirty-three (30.3%) patients reported 65adverse events and were mostly (86%) mild. CONCLUSIONS: 2-DG 90 mg/kg/day asadjunct to SOC showed clinical benefit over SOC alone in the treatment ofmoderate to severe COVID-19. The promising trends observed in current phase IIstudy is encouraging for confirmatory evaluation of the efficacy and safety of2-DG in a larger phase III trial.

TI  - Analysis of the uptake and associated factors for virtual crisis care during the pandemic at a 24-h mental health crisis centre in Manitoba, Canada.
PG  - 527
LID - 10.1186/s12888-022-04166-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic necessitated the rapid transition to virtualcare. At a 24-h walk-in mental health Crisis Response Centre (CRC) in Winnipeg,Canada we adapted crisis mental health assessments to be offered virtually while the crisis centre also remained open to in person visits. Little is known aboutthe sustainability of virtual visits in the presence of comparable in personcare, and which visits are more likely to be done virtually, particularly in the crisis setting. METHODS: An analysis of visits to the CRC from the first locallockdown on March 19, 2020 through the third local wave with heightened publichealth restrictions in June 2021. Analysis of Variance was used to compare theproportion of visits occurring virtually (telephone or videoconference) duringthe first wave of heightened public health restrictions (lockdown 1) andsubsequent lockdowns as well as the in-between periods. A binary logisticregression examined visit, sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with receipt of a virtual visit compared to an in person visit over the first year of the pandemic. RESULTS: Out of 5,357 visits, 993 (18.5%) occurred virtually. Therewas a significant difference in proportion of virtual visits across the pandemic time periods (F(4, 62) = 8.56, p < .001). The proportion of visits occurringvirtually was highest during lockdown 1 (mean 32.6% by week), with no differencesbetween the other time periods. Receipt of a virtual visit was significantlyassociated with daytime weekday visits, age, non-male gender, living further awayfrom the CRC, no prior year contact with the CRC, and visits that did not featuresuicidal behaviour, substance use, psychosis or cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of virtual care occurring at the outset of thepandemic reflects public anxiety and care avoidance paired with health systemrapid transformation. The use of virtual visits reduced over subsequent pandemic periods but was sustained at a meaningful level. Specific visit, sociodemographicand clinical characteristics are more likely to be present in visits occurringvirtually compared to those in person. These results can help to inform thefuture planning and delivery of virtual crisis care.

TI  - On the frontlines : An exploratory analysis of unequal exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 in the United States.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s12939-022-01705-5 [doi]
AB  - Recent literature has suggested a link between poor air quality and worseCOVID-19 outcomes. In the United States, this link is particularly noteworthybecause of residential sorting along ethnic lines within the US population;minorities are disproportionately exposed to health hazards, including airpollution. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have also been disproportionatelyconcentrated amongst minorities. We explore the association between air qualityand COVID-19 outcomes, using county level data for the United States from thefirst wave of the pandemic in 2020, and test whether exposure to more pollutedair can account for some of the observed disparities in COVID-19 outcomes amongminorities.

TI  - Measuring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Dine and White Mountain Apache school personnel, families, and students: protocol for a prospective longitudinalcohort study.
PG  - 1481
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13208-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper describes the protocol for a longitudinal cohort study,"Project SafeSchools" (PSS), which focuses on measuring the effects of COVID-19and the return to in-person learning on Dine (Navajo) and White Mountain Apache(Apache) youth, parents, and educators. The early surges of the COVID-19 pandemicled to the closure of most reservation and border town schools serving Dine andApache communities. This study aims to: (1) understand the barriers andfacilitators to school re-opening and in-person school attendance from theperspective of multiple stakeholders in Dine and Apache communities; and (2)evaluate the educational, social, emotional, physical, and mental health impacts of returning to in-person learning for caregivers and youth ages 4-16 who reside or work on the Dine Nation and the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands. METHODS:We aim to recruit up to N = 200 primary caregivers of Dine and Apache youth ages 4-16 and up to N = 120 school personnel. In addition, up to n = 120 of theseprimary caregivers and their children, ages 11-16, will be selected toparticipate in qualitative interviews to learn more about the effects of thepandemic on their health and wellbeing. Data from caregiver and school personnel participants will be collected in three waves via self-report surveys thatmeasure COVID-19 related behaviors and attitudes, mental health, educationalattitudes, and cultural practices and beliefs for both themselves and their child(caregiver participants only). We hypothesize that an individual's engagementwith a variety of cultural activities during school closures and as schoolre-opened will have a protective effect on adult and youth mental health as they return to in-person learning. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will informthe development or implementation of preventative interventions that may helpDine and Apache youth and their families recover from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and positively impact their health and wellness.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency hospital cancer admissions in a UKregion.
PG  - 850
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09932-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pandemic disrupted society and health services through lockdowns and resource reallocation to care for COVID-19 patients. Reductions in numbers ofcancer patients having surgery, being diagnosed pathologically or via 2-weekwait, and screening programs pauses have been described. The effect on emergency presentation, which represents an acute episode with poor outcomes, has not been investigated. This study explored the pandemic's impact on emergency hospitaladmissions for cancer patients in a UK region. METHODS: Hospital discharge datafor cancer patients in Northern Ireland, which included route to admission, were analysed for the pandemic era in 2020 compared to averages for March to December 2017-2019, focusing on volume and route of emergency admissions by demography andtumour site. FINDINGS: Compared with the pre-pandemic era, the number of canceremergency admissions fell by 12.3% in 2020. Emergency admissions for cancer were significantly reduced when COVID-19 levels were highest (- 18.5% in April and -16.8% in October). Females (- 15.8%), urban residents (- 13.2%), and age groups 0to 49 and 65-74 years old (- 17%) experienced the largest decreases as did those with haematological (- 14.7%), brain and CNS (- 27.9%), and lung cancers(-14.3%). Significant reductions in referrals from outpatient departments (- 51%)and primary care (- 43%) (p < 0.001) were counterbalanced by admissions fromother routes including confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection (increase83.6%). INTERPRETATION: Reductions in emergency admissions, and pathologicallydiagnosed cancers, as reported by the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR),indicate undiagnosed patients in the community which has implications for future workloads and survival. Data suggest undiagnosed cases may be higher forhaematological, brain and CNS, and lung cancers and among females. Efforts shouldbe made to encourage people with symptoms to present for diagnosis orreassurance. FUNDING: The NICR is funded by the Public Health Agency of Northern Ireland. This work was supported by Macmillan Cancer Support and uses datacollected by health services as part of their care and support functions.

TI  - Assessing Case Fatality on Cases of Thrombosis with Concurrent ThrombocytopeniaFollowing COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) in the United Kingdom: AReview of Spontaneously Reported Data.
LID - 10.1007/s40264-022-01217-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) events were reportedvery rarely following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine AstraZeneca(Vaxzevria). Clinical and demographic characteristics of the affected people,including the outcomes of TTS events, need to be examined using availableinformation to better understand aspects of this association. OBJECTIVE: Toanalyse clinical and demographic information of TTS events, including calculatingthe case fatality of reported cases of TTS by age and sex, using spontaneouslyreported data from the UK's Yellow Card spontaneous reporting system of suspectedadverse drug reactions. METHODS: TTS events reported to the Yellow Card schemewere extracted at weekly time points between 12 May 2021 and 25 May 2022.Cumulative numbers of TTS cases and deaths were recorded for each weeklyinterval, overall and stratified by age, sex, and vaccine dose. RESULTS: To 25May 2022, 443 cases (81 fatal, 18.28%) had been reported in the UK. Events morefrequently occurred following the first vaccine dose. No trends were observed forcase fatality overall, or by age or sex. CONCLUSION: In the UK, case fatality of TTS events reported to the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)following Vaxzevria has been approximately 17-18% since May 2021. There were nostatistical differences in fatality based on age or sex. Most reports followedthe first vaccine dose; none have been reported following a third dose to date,although Vaxzervia was not recommended for a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine inthe UK. TTS remains very rare, and benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.

PG  - 13404
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17542-z [doi]
AB  - We aimed to analyze the nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles in pregnant women withand without SARS-CoV-2 infection, considered a vulnerable population duringCOVID-19 pandemic. Pregnant women were enrolled from a multicenter prospectivepopulation-based cohort during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave in Spain (March-June2020 in Barcelona, Spain) in which the status of SARS-CoV-2 infection wasdetermined by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and antibodies in peripheral blood. Womenwere randomly selected for this cross-sectional study on microbiota. DNA wasextracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples, and the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA of bacteria was amplified using region-specific primers. The differentialabundance of taxa was tested, and alpha/beta diversity was evaluated. Among 76women, 38 were classified as positive and 38 as negative for SARS-CoV-2infection. All positive women were diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM/IgAantibodies, and 14 (37%) also had a positive RT-PCR. The overall composition ofthe nasopharyngeal microbiota differ in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies), compared to those without the infection(negative SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) (p = 0.001), with a higher relative abundance ofthe Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes phyla and a higher abundance of thePrevotellaceae family. Infected women presented a different pattern of microbiotaprofiling due to beta diversity and higher richness (observed ASV < 0.001) andevenness (Shannon index < 0.001) at alpha diversity. These changes were alsopresent in women after acute infection, as revealed by negative RT-PCR butpositive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting a potential association betweenSARS-CoV-2 infection and long-lasting shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiota. No significant differences were reported in mild vs. severe cases. This is the firststudy on nasopharyngeal microbiota during pregnancy. Pregnant women withSARS-CoV-2 infection had a different nasopharyngeal microbiota profile comparedto negative cases.

TI  - Active and avoidant coping profiles in children and their relationship withanxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 13430
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15793-4 [doi]
AB  - Active and avoidant coping styles are important dispositional factors in thedevelopment of anxiety and depression symptoms. Children use both active andavoidant coping strategies together in daily life. No studies have investigatedthe relationship between active-avoidant coping profiles and internalizingsymptoms in children. The present study aimed to investigate children'sactive-avoidant coping profiles and assess the relationship that active-avoidant coping profiles have with anxiety and depression symptoms. A two-wavelongitudinal study was conducted among 322 Chinese children in the People'sRepublic of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed theChildren's Coping Strategies Checklist-Revised 1 at Time 1 and the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale at Time 1 and 6 months later (Time 2). Fouractive-avoidant coping profiles were revealed: low active copers, high activecopers, balanced copers, and avoidant copers. Low and high active copers hadlower levels of anxiety and depression symptoms than balanced copers and avoidantcopers. Avoidant copers showed a larger decrease in depression symptoms thanbalanced copers and high active copers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It isimportant to improve children's active-avoidant coping profiles to relieveanxiety and depression symptoms.

TI  - IgA vasculitis with transient glomerular hematuria, diarrhea, and pericarditisfollowing COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in a young patient with possible pre-existingulcerative colitis.
LID - 10.1007/s13730-022-00727-w [doi]
AB  - Exacerbations or de novo autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease have been reportedafter COVID-19 vaccination. A young male presented with cutaneous IgA vasculitis with glomerular hematuria, diarrhea and pericarditis following his secondCOVID-19 mRNA vaccination. He also showed positivity for proteinase 3anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) and anti-cardiolipin antibody.Skin biopsy was compatible to IgA vasculitis. His purpura subsided and hematuria spontaneously disappeared. Treatment with anti-inflammatory medications andprednisolone resolved the pericarditis. He had a history of persistent diarrhea, and colonic biopsies showed possible ulcerative colitis without vasculitis.Kidney biopsy after prednisolone therapy revealed minor glomerular abnormalities without any immune reactants and did not show vasculitis. After prednisolonetreatment, PR3-ANCA decreased in a medium degree despite of improvement ofsymptoms and inflammatory data, suggesting that his PR3-ANCA may be associatedwith ulcerative colitis. The cause of the transient glomerular hematuria wasunclear, however, it might be caused by focal glomerular active lesions(glomerular vasculitis) due to vaccine-induced IgA vasculitis with nephritis.This case highlights that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination can activate multipleautoimmune/autoinflammatory systems. The conditions might help us betterunderstand the mutual mechanisms of the relevant disorders.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Chinese population.
LID - 10.1007/s10096-022-04478-5 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern. Thepurpose of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variantsand SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 severity in Chinese population. A totalof 256 individuals including 87 symptomatic patients (tested positive forSARS-CoV-2), 84 asymptomatic cases, and 85 close contacts of confirmed patients(tested negative for SARS-CoV-2) were recruited from February 2020 to May 2020.We carried out the whole exome genome sequencing between the individuals andconducted a genetic association study for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19severity. In total, we analyzed more than 100,000 single-nucleotidepolymorphisms. The genome-wide association study suggested potential correlation between genetic variability in POLR2A, ANKRD27, MAN1A2, and ERAP1 genes andSARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility. The most significant gene locus associatedwith SARS-CoV-2 infection was located in POLR2A (p = 5.71 x 10(-6)). Furthermore,genetic variants in PCNX2, CD200R1L, ZMAT3, PLCL2, NEIL3, and LINC00700 genes (p < 1 x 10(-5)) were closely associated with the COVID-19 severity in Chinesepopulation. Our study confirmed that new genetic variant loci had significantassociation with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 severity in Chinesepopulation, which provided new clues for the studies on the susceptibility ofSARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 severity. These findings may give a better understanding on the molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 and genetic basis ofheterogeneous susceptibility, with potential impact on new therapeutic options.

TI  - Non-invasive detection of COVID-19 using a microfluidic-based colorimetric sensorarray sensitive to urinary metabolites.
PG  - 316
LID - 10.1007/s00604-022-05423-1 [doi]
AB  - A colorimetric sensor array designed on a paper substrate with a microfluidicstructure has been developed. This array is capable of detecting COVID-19 diseaseby tracking metabolites of urine samples. In order to determine minor metabolicchanges, various colorimetric receptors consisting of gold and silvernanoparticles, metalloporphyrins, metal ion complexes, and pH-sensitiveindicators are used in the array structure. By injecting a small volume of theurine sample, the color pattern of the sensor changes after 7 min, which can beobserved visually. The color changes of the receptors (recorded by a scanner) aresubsequently calculated by image analysis software and displayed as a colordifference map. This study has been performed on 130 volunteers, including 60patients infected by COVID-19, 55 healthy controls, and 15 cured individuals. Theresulting array provides a fingerprint response for each category due to thedifferences in the metabolic profile of the urine sample. The principal componentanalysis-discriminant analysis confirms that the assay sensitivity to thecorrectly detected patient, healthy, and cured participants is equal to 73.3%,74.5%, and 66.6%, respectively. Apart from COVID-19, other diseases such aschronic kidney disease, liver disorder, and diabetes may be detectable by theproposed sensor. However, this performance of the sensor must be tested in thestudies with a larger sample size. These results show the possible feasibility ofthe sensor as a suitable alternative to costly and time-consuming standardmethods for rapid detection and control of viral and bacterial infectiousdiseases and metabolic disorders.

TI  - Preterm birth among pregnant persons with severe acute respiratory syndromeCoronavirus 2 infection.
LID - 10.1038/s41372-022-01467-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between trimester of SARS-CoV-2infection, illness severity, and risk for preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: Weanalyzed data for 6336 pregnant persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020 in the United States. Risk ratios for preterm birth were calculated for illnessseverity, trimester of infection, and illness severity stratified by trimester ofinfection adjusted for age, selected underlying medical conditions, and pregnancycomplications. RESULT: Pregnant persons with critical COVID-19 or asymptomaticinfection, compared to mild COVID-19, in the second or third trimester were atincreased risk of preterm birth. Pregnant persons with moderate-to-severeCOVID-19 did not show increased risk of preterm birth in any trimester.CONCLUSION: Critical COVID-19 in the second or third trimester was associatedwith increased risk of preterm birth. This finding can be used to guideprevention strategies, including vaccination, and inform clinical practices forpregnant persons.

AB  - In this paper, we study the Covid 19 disease profile in the Algerian territorysince February 25, 2020 to February 13, 2021. The idea is to develop a decisionsupport system allowing public health decision and policy-makers to have futurestatistics (the daily prediction of parameters) of the pandemic; and alsoencourage citizens for conducting health protocols. Many studies appliedtraditional epidemic models or machine learning models to forecast the evolution of coronavirus epidemic, but the use of such models alone to make the prediction will be less precise. For this purpose, we assume that the spread of thecoronavirus is a moving target described by an epidemic model. On the basis of a SIRD model (Susceptible-Infection-Recovery- Death), we applied the EKF algorithm to predict daily all parameters. These predicted parameters will be muchbeneficial to hospital managers for updating the available means ofhospitalization (beds, oxygen concentrator, etc.) in order to reduce themortality rate and the infected. Simulations carried out reveal that the EKFseems to be more efficient according to the obtained results.

AB  - Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection has primarily been achieved using reverse transcriptase polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) for acute infection, and serology for prior infection.Assay with RT-PCR provides data on presence or absence of viral RNA, with noinformation on virus replication competence, infectivity, or viruscharacterisation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) istypically not used in clinical virology, despite its potential to providesupplemental data about the presence of viral proteins and thus the potential forreplication-competent, transmissible virus. Using the SARS-CoV-2 as a modelvirus, we developed a fast 'bottom-up' proteomics workflow for discovery oftarget virus peptides using 'serum-free' culture conditions, providing highcoverage of viral proteins without the need for protein or peptide fractionation techniques. This workflow was then applied to Coronaviruses OC43 and 229E,Influenza A/H1N1 and H3N2, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Viruses A andB. Finally, we created an LC-MS/MS method for targeted detection of theeight-virus panel in clinical specimens, successfully detecting peptides from theSARS-CoV-2 ORF9B and nucleoprotein in RT-PCR positive samples. The methodprovides specific detection of respiratory viruses from clinical samplescontaining moderate viral loads and is an important further step to the use ofLC-MS/MS in diagnosis of viral infection.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17505-4 [doi]
AB  - This paper studies an adjacent accumulation discrete grey model to improve theprediction of the grey model and enhance the utilization of new data. The impact of COVID-19 on the global economy is also discussed. Two cases are discussed toprove the stability of the adjacent accumulation discrete grey model, whichhelped the studied model attain higher forecasting accuracy. Using the adjacentaccumulation discrete grey model, non-renewable energy consumption in G20countries from 2022 to 2026 is predicted based on their consumption data from2011 to 2021. It is proven that the adjacent accumulation exhibits sufficientaccuracy and precision. Forecasting results obtained in this paper show thatenergy consumption of all the non-renewable sources other than coal has anincreasing trend during the forecasting period, with the USA, Russia, and Chinabeing the biggest consumers. Natural gas is the most consumed non-renewableenergy source between 2022 and 2026, whereas hydroelectricity is the leastconsumed. The USA is the biggest consumer of Nuclear energy among the G20countries, whereas Argentina consumed only 0.1 Exajoules of nuclear energy,placing it at the end of nuclear energy consumers.

AB  - Immunocompromised patients are predisposed to severe COVID-19. Here we comparehomotypic and heterotypic humoral and cellular immune responses to Omicron BA.1in organ transplant patients across a diverse clinical spectrum. We performvariant-specific pseudovirus neutralization assays for D614G, and Omicron-BA.1,-BA.2, and Delta variants. We also measure poly-and monofunctional T-cellresponses to BA.1 and ancestral SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. We identify thatpartially or fully-vaccinated transplant recipients after infection with Omicron BA.1 have the greatest BA.1 neutralizing antibody and BA.1-specificpolyfunctional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses, with potentcross-neutralization against BA.2. In these patients, the magnitude of theBA.1-directed response is comparable to immunocompetent triple-vaccinatedcontrols. A subset of patients with pre-Omicron infection have heterotypicresponses to BA.1 and BA.2, whereas uninfected transplant patients with threedoses of vaccine demonstrate the weakest comparative responses. These resultshave implications for risk of infection, re-infection, and disease severity amongimmune compromised hosts with Omicron infection.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16330-z [doi]
AB  - The widespread COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed many people's ways oflife. With the necessity of social distancing and lock downs across the UnitedStates, evidence shows more people engage in outdoor activities. With theutilization of location-based service (LBS) data, we seek to explore howvisitation patterns to national parks changed among communities of color duringthe COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that visitation rates to national parkslocated closer than 347 km to individuals have increased amidst the pandemic, butthe converse was demonstrated amongst parks located further than 347 km fromindividuals. More importantly, COVID-19 has adversely impacted visitation figuresamongst non-white and Native American communities, with visitation volumesdeclining if these communities are situated further from national parks. Ourresults show disproportionately low-representations amongst national parkvisitors from these communities of color. African American communities display a particularly concerning trend whereby their visitation to national parks issubstantially lower amongst communities closer to national parks.

AB  - Delineating the origins and properties of antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2infection and vaccination is critical for understanding their benefits andpotential shortcomings. Therefore, we investigate the SARS-CoV-2 spike(S)-reactive B cell repertoire in unexposed individuals by flow cytometry andsingle-cell sequencing. We show that approximately 82% of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive Bcells harbor a naive phenotype, which represents an unusually high fraction oftotal human naive B cells ( approximately 0.1%). Approximately 10% of these naiveS-reactive B cells share an IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing, anenrichment of 18-fold compared to the complete naive repertoire. FollowingSARS-CoV-2 infection, we report an average 37-fold enrichment ofIGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing in the S-reactive memory B cellscompared to the unselected memory repertoire. This class of B cells targets apreviously undefined non-neutralizing epitope on the S2 subunit that becomesexposed on S proteins used in approved vaccines when they transition away fromthe native pre-fusion state because of instability. These findings can help guidethe improvement of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

TI  - Olfactory impairment in psychiatric disorders: Does nasal inflammation impactdisease psychophysiology?
PG  - 314
LID - 10.1038/s41398-022-02081-y [doi]
AB  - Olfactory impairments contribute to the psychopathology of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Recent neuroscience research has shed light onthe previously underappreciated olfactory neural circuits involved in regulation of higher brain functions. Although environmental factors such as air pollutants and respiratory viral infections are known to contribute to the risk forpsychiatric disorders, the role of nasal inflammation in neurobehavioral outcomesand disease pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Here, we will firstprovide an overview of published findings on the impact of nasal inflammation in the olfactory system. We will then summarize clinical studies on olfactoryimpairments in schizophrenia and depression, followed by preclinical evidence on the neurobehavioral outcomes produced by olfactory dysfunction. Lastly, we willdiscuss the potential impact of nasal inflammation on brain development andfunction, as well as how we can address the role of nasal inflammation in thepathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Considering thecurrent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which often causes nasalinflammation and serious adverse effects for olfactory function that might resultin long-lasting neuropsychiatric sequelae, this line of research is particularly critical to understanding of the potential significance of nasal inflammation in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive effects on the situation of publicmental health. A fast online questionnaire for screening and evaluating mentalsymptoms is urgent. In this work, we developed a new 19-item self-assessment FastScreen Questionnaire for Mental Illness Symptoms (FSQ-MIS) to quickly identifymental illness symptoms. The FSQ-MIS was validated on a total of 3828 young adultmental disorder patients and 984 healthy controls. We applied principal componentanalysis (PCA), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and generallog-linear analysis (GLA) to evaluate the construct and parallel validity.Results demonstrate that the proposed FSQ-MIS shows high test-retest reliability (0.852) and split-half reliability (0.844). Six factors obtained using PCAexplained 54.3% of the variance and showed high correlations with other widelyused scales. The ROC results (0.716-0.983) revealed high criterion validity ofFSQ-MIS. GLA demonstrated the advantage of FSQ-MIS in predicting anxiety anddepression prevalence in COVID-19, supporting the efficiency of FSQ-MIS as a toolfor research and clinical practice.

TI  - Stress and mental health in adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis oneyear after the COVID pandemic: Findings from an Italian sample.
LID - 10.1002/ppul.26087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 was associated with increased stress and newmental health concerns for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), already atincreased risk for depression and anxiety. This study assessed stress and mental health in adolescents and young adults with CF one year from when the pandemicbegan. METHODS: Sixty-six pwCF (mean age=24; range 14-36) completed a new measureof the impact of COVID-19 (COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scale-Adolescence and Young Adult; CEFIS-AYA); the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and theGeneralized Anxiety Disorder-7. The Italian translation of the CEFIS-AYA wasperformed. RESULTS: On the CEFIS-AYA, the mean Exposure score was 5.2 (SD=2.6)out of 28. The mean Impact score was 1.8 (SD=0.7; negative valence >2.5).Individuals were more sedentary and undertaking less exercise. Average stressrating was 5.9 (SD=2), indicating moderate stress. No significant differenceswere found between those who did (N=12) vs did not have a COVID infection (N=54).A high percentage of participants scored above the clinical cut-off fordepression (45%) and anxiety (41%), with a low proportion reportingmoderate-severe symptomatology. CONCLUSION: After one-year, the pandemic washaving a less significant impact on patients' daily lives. Sedentary activity andreduced exercise were common. Despite expectations that this group wasparticularly vulnerable, depression and anxiety scores were similar to the rates described for this population prior to the pandemic. Overall, these resultssuggested that pwCF are highly resilient and nearly one year after the onset ofCOVID-19, have returned to similar daily activities and emotional health.

TI  - Structural Analysis of the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Variants and OtherBetacoronaviruses Using Molecular Dynamics.
LID - 10.1002/cphc.202200382 [doi]
AB  - A structural analysis over various spike proteins from three highly pathogenicBetacoronavirus was done to understand their structural differences. The proteinswere modeled using crystal structures from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and otherBetacoronavirus that infect bats and Chinese pangolins. The group was split intwo sets; the first set corresponds to the non-mutated spike proteins, while the second set corresponds to mutated spike variants alpha, beta, gamma, delta,omicron and mu; five of them classified as variants of concern and the last oneas variant of interest. A conformational space exploration was carried out forevery protein by using molecular dynamic simulations. Root mean squarefluctuations, principal component and cross-correlation analysis were carried outover the dynamics to analyze the flexibility and rigidity of every protein incomparison to the wild type Spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2. The obtainedresults indicate that the proteins, which are not spread among humans, havesmooth movements compared to those of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. In addition, arelationship between the speed of the virulence and the movement of the proteincan explain the behavior of delta and omicron variants.

AB  - The use of heparin for anticoagulation has changed the face of cardiac surgery byallowing a bloodless and motionless surgical field throughout the introduction ofcardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, heparin is a drug with complexpharmacologic properties that can cause significant interpatient differences interms of responsiveness. Heparin resistance during CPB is a weighty issue due to the catastrophic consequences stemming from inadequate anticoagulation, and thetreatment of it necessitates a rationalized stepwise approach due to themultifactorial contributions toward this entity. The widespread use of activated clotting time (ACT) as a measurement of anticoagulation during CPB is examined,as it may be a false indicator of heparin resistance. Heparin resistance also hasbeen repeatedly reported in patients infected with COVID-19, which deservesfurther exploration in this pandemic era. This review aims to examine thevariability in heparin potency, underlying mechanisms, and limitations of usingACT for monitoring, as well as provide a framework towards the current managementof heparin resistance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Europe in March 2020 and createdmajor challenges across healthcare provision and for healthcare educationprogrammes as well as having a major impact on society. Within the profession of Radiography changes in medical imaging, radiotherapy, and teaching practices havebeen reported along with the negative impact on radiographers and students. Theaim of this study was to investigate key challenges relating to academic practiceduring the COIVD-19 pandemic; how radiography academics have coped and toidentify recommendations for further support required to facilitate recovery ofthe academic faculty as the pandemic ebbs. METHODS: A survey was circulated usingSurveyMonkey via personal, national and international networks, including theEuropean Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS), to reach as many academicradiographers as possible. Open questions relating to the challenges of providingradiography education during the COVID-19 pandemic and the and coping strategies used were included. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo (QSRInternational, MA). RESULTS: 533 academic radiographers responded to the wholesurvey from 43 different countries, with 340 responses relating to challenges and327 for coping strategies. The main themes for the challenges were clinicalpractice, communication with colleagues, lack of face to face, managing change,students (support), and staff support. The coping strategy themes werecommunication with colleagues, physical exercise, self-care and wellbeing.CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a multitude of challenges for academicradiographers and the pressure they worked under during the first year of theCOVID-19 pandemic was clear. However, the majority employed healthy copingstrategies to help them deal with the pressure, uncertainty and trauma of thesituation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: COVID-19 had a significant impact onacademic radiographers and while many reported good strategies for coping, thelevel of pressure is unsustainable. This study highlights the need to supportacademic radiographers to ensure a sustainable workforce.

LID - 10.1016/j.idh.2022.06.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care professionals (HCP) were obliged to wear personalprotective equipment (PPE) during pandemic in order to minimize the risk oftransmission of the emerging virus. The objective of the study was to estimatethe prevalence of adverse effects related to the wear of PPE among HCP and todeterminate their predictive factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional studyincluding a representative sample of 300 randomized HCP at Hedi Chaker UniversityHospital Sfax, Tunisia, during the period August-September 2021. Data collection was carried out by an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: PPErelated adverse effects were noted among 87 HCP with a prevalence of 57.2%.Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with PPEadverse effects were female gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.8; p = 0.048), chronic diseases (AOR = 0.29; p = 0.001) and previous infection with COVID-19(AOR = 0.46; p = 0.004). Frequent use of bleach or other disinfection productwithout protection and use of hot water at work were independently associatedwith a high risk of adverse effects ((AOR = 2.22; p = 0.003) and (AOR = 2.83; p =0.005), respectively). Similarly, a duration of use of PPE>4 h per day (AOR =1.98; p = 0.039), as well as use of visors and/or glasses (AOR = 1.84; p = 0.045)were independently associated with PPE related adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Theprevalence of adverse effects related to the wear of PPE was alarmingly highamong HCP. Multiple risk factors were highlighted, notably professional aspects. Adequate and repetitive training for caregivers on the correct use of PPE remain essential to manage this problem.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to evaluate the association between 'asymptomatic ormildly symptomatic' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (AS/MS-COVID) and surgical site infection (SSI) after repair ofcraniomaxillofacial injury (CMFI). Using a case-control study design with a matchratio of 1:4, we enrolled a cohort of AS/MS-COVID cases with immediately treated CMFI during a one-year period. The main predictor variable was SARS-CoV-2infection (yes/no), and the outcome of interest was SSI (yes/no). The othervariables were demographic, clinical, and operative. Appropriate statistics were computed, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study groupcomprised 257 cases (28.8% female; 13.2% aged >/= 60 years; 10.5% with fractures;39.7% with involvement of nasal/oral/orbital tissue [viral reservoir organs,VROs]; 81.3% with blunt trauma; 19.1% developed an SSI [vs 6.8% in the controlgroup]) with a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (16.6) years (range 19-87). There was asignificant relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and SSI events (p<0.0001; odds ratio 3.22; 95% confidence interval 2.17 to 4.78). On subgroup analysis, SSIssignificantly increased with age >/= 60 years, presence and treatment offracture, contact with VROs, and prolonged antibiotic use (PAU). However,multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed a positive effect only fromold age, contact with VROs, and PAU (relative risk = 1.56, 2.52, and 2.03,respectively; r = 0.49; p = 0.0001). There was a significant 2.8-fold increase inSSIs among AS/MS-COVID cases, especially in those aged >/= 60 years, or thosewith injuries to VROs, or both, who therefore required PAU.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the cause of the COVID-19, whichcaused a global pandemic. It is a pathogen that causes respiratory disease andcan easily navigate the interspecies barrier. A significant number of COVID-19cases in animals have been reported worldwide, including but not limited toanimals in farms, captivity, and household pets. Thus, assessing the affectedpopulation and anticipating 'at risk' population becomes essential. OBJECTIVES:This article aims to emphasize the zoonotic potential of SARS- CoV-2 and discuss the One Health aspects of the disease. CONTENT: This is a narrative review ofrecently published studies on animals infected with SARS-CoV-2, both experimentaland natural. The elucidation of the mechanism of infection by binding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE-2 receptor cells in humans has led to bioinformaticanalysis that has identified a few other susceptible species in silico. Whileinfections in animals have been extensively reported, no intermediary host hasyet been identified for this disease. The articles collected in this review have been grouped into four categories; experimental inoculations, infection in wildanimals, infection in farm animals and infection in pet animals, along with areview of literature in each category. The risk of infection transmission betweenhumans and animals and vice versa and the importance of the One Health approachhas been discussed at length in this article.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic occurred during the interviewperiod for numerous surgical fellowships, resulting in most programstransitioning to a virtual interview format during the 2020-2021 applicationcycle. This study investigated modifications adopted by fellowship programs andperceptions of the virtual interview format among hand surgery fellowshipapplicants. METHODS: Voluntary, anonymous online surveys were emailed to allapplicants to the Johns Hopkins hand surgery fellowship during the 2020-2021interview cycle. The surveys were released after the rank order listcertification deadline on May 6, 2021, and closed on May 18, 2021, before thematch results were released. Descriptive statistics based on the overall cohortand primary outcome of an applicant's willingness to recommend virtual interviewsin the future were conducted. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 112 (30.4%) applicantscompleted their surveys. Twenty-seven (79.4%) survey respondents recommended the virtual interview format in the future and 7 (20.6%) did not. Applicants whorecommended virtual interviews were similar to those who did not on the basis of the number of interviews received and taken, information provided by programs,and self-rated competency with the virtual interview format. Those whorecommended virtual interviews rated the effectiveness of self-advocacy highercompared with those who did not. All respondents agreed that cost savings andscheduling were more effective with virtual interviews. Perceived weaknessesdiffered between the 2 groups and included the lack of physical tour, difficulty with self-advocacy, and technical difficulties. The majority of surveyrespondents preferred in-person interviews before the interview cycle (n = 32,94.1%), whereas nearly half of survey respondents preferred virtual interviewsafter the interview cycle (n = 16, 47.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 80% of surveyrespondents recommended virtual interviews in the future. Major benefits includedeffectiveness of scheduling and cost savings. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Virtualinterviews may be considered as an alternative or adjunct to in-person handsurgery fellowship interviews in the future.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to examine factors associated with parentalintention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 in Ohio following pediatricvaccine approval in October 2021. METHOD: Online anonymous surveys weredistributed between November 2021 and January 2022 to parents in Ohio. RESULTS:Surveys were completed by 581 parents of whom 43.5% reported they intended tovaccinate their children against COVID-19, whereas 56.5% did not intend tovaccinate their children. Perceiving a lack of support by health care providerswas significantly associated with not intending to vaccinate children againstCOVID-19 (p < .001). DISCUSSION: Survey results from parents in Ohio indicatethat perceived health care provider support and parents' attitudes aboutpediatric COVID-19 vaccination influenced their intent to vaccinate theirchildren. Hence, health care providers working with families need to focus oneducating parents regarding the importance and safety of vaccination.

AB  - The assessment of hospitalisations and intensive care is crucial for planninghealth care resources needed over the course of the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic. Nonetheless, comparative empirical assessments of COVID-19hospitalisations and related fatality risk patterns on a large scale are lacking.This paper exploits anonymised, individual-level data on SARS-CoV-2 confirmedinfections collected and harmonized by the European Centre for Disease Preventionand Control to profile the demographics of COVID-19 hospitalised patients across nine European countries during the first pandemic wave (February - June 2020). Weestimate the role of demographic factors for the risk of in-hospital mortality,and present a case study exploring individuals' comorbidities based on a subsetof COVID-19 hospitalised patients available from the Dutch health system. We findthat hospitalisation rates are highest among individuals with confirmedSARS-CoV-2 infection who are not only older than 70 years, but also 50-69 years. The latter group has a longer median time between COVID-19 symptoms' onset andhospitalisation than those aged 70+ years. Men have higher hospitalisation rates than women at all ages, and particularly above age 50. Consistently, men aged50-59 years have a probability of hospitalisation almost double than women do.Although the gender imbalance in hospitalisation remains above age 70, the gapbetween men and women narrows at older ages. Comorbidities play a key role inexplaining selection effects of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases requiringhospitalisation. Our study contributes to the evaluation of the COVID-19 burdenon the demand of health-care during emergency phases. Assessing intensity andtiming dimensions of hospital admissions, our findings allow for a betterunderstanding of COVID-19 severe outcomes. Results point to the need of suitable calibrations of epidemiological projections and (re)planning of health services, enhancing preparedness to deal with infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - Based on natural infection or vaccination, the protective barrier for population has been preliminarily established. However, with constant appearances ofSARS-CoV-2 variants, breakthrough infection events cannot be completely avoided, and thus the diagnostic strategy is still the key to discovering epidemic sourcesand blocking the transmission chain. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis technologiesbased on nucleic acid, antigen and antibody detections have developed andextended in diversity. Under the background of work resumption andepidemic-prevention normalization during the later COVID-19 era, it is necessary for us to choose appropriate detection methods to satisfy the need of epidemicprevention and control in various scenarios. We summarized the principles andapplicable characteristics of existing SARS-CoV-2 detection technologies in this paper, aimed to provide guidance for clinical and public health personnel to maketargeted decisions.

LID - medethics-2022-108450 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/jme-2022-108450 [doi]
AB  - We would like to thank each of the commentators on our feature article for their thoughtful engagement with our arguments. All the commentaries raise importantquestions about our proposed justification for natural immunity exemptions toCOVID-19 vaccine mandates. Thankfully, for some of the points raised, we cansimply signal our agreement. For instance, Reiss is correct to highlight that ourarticle did not address the important US-centric considerations she helpfullyraises and fruitfully discusses. We also agree with Williams about the need toprovide a clear rationale for mandates, and to obtain different kinds of data in support of possible policies.Unfortunately, we lack the space to engage withevery one of the more critical comments raised in this rich set of commentaries; as such, in this response, we shall focus on a discussion of hybrid immunity,which underlies a number of different arguments evident in the commentaries,before concluding with some reflections responding to Lipsitch's concern aboutthe appropriate standard of proof in this context.

LID - medethics-2022-108194 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/jme-2022-108194 [doi]
AB  - Equity was-and is-central in the US policy response to COVID-19, given itsdisproportionate impact on disadvantaged communities of colour. In anunprecedented turn, the majority of US states used place-based disadvantageindices to promote equity in vaccine allocation (eg, through larger vaccineshares for more disadvantaged areas and people of colour).We conducted anationally representative survey experiment (n=2003) in April 2021 (before all USresidents had become vaccine eligible), that examined respondents' perceptions ofthe acceptability of disadvantage indices relative to two ways of prioritisingracial and ethnic groups more directly, and assessed the role of framing andexpert anchors in shaping perceptions.A majority of respondents supported the useof disadvantage indices, and one-fifth opposed any of the three equity-promoting plans. Differences in support and opposition were identified by respondents'political party affiliation. Providing a numerical anchor (that indicated expert recommendations and states' actual practices in reserving a proportion ofallocations for prioritised groups) led respondents to prefer a lowerdistribution of reserved vaccine allocations compared with the randomisedcondition without this anchor, and the effect of the anchor differed across theframes.Our findings support ongoing uses of disadvantage indices in vaccineallocation, and, by extension, in allocating tests, masks or treatments,especially when supply cannot meet demand. The findings can also inform USallocation frameworks in future pandemic planning, and could provide lessons onhow to promote equity in clinical and public health outside of the pandemicsetting.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the impact of occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2positive patients and SARS-CoV-2 positive coworkers, by comparing the frequencyof occupational exposure incidents and the rate of healthcare personnel (HCP) whodeveloped a positive PCR test for SARS-COV-2 after occupational exposure to thetwo different types of infectious individuals. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all confirmed higher risk occupational exposure incidents that occurred in HCPfrom 20 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 at a large multisite US academic medicalcentre. Comparisons between groups for source type were performed using unpaired Student's t-test for continuous variables and the chi(2) test for categoricalvariables, regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations betweensource type and risk of positive COVID-19 test after occupational exposure.RESULTS: In total, 2253 confirmed medium or high-risk occupational exposuresoccurred during the study period. 57% were exposures from coworker sources. Each source individual exposed a mean of 2.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.9) HCP; duringpostexposure surveillance, 4.5% of exposed HCP tested positive within 14 days. A coworker source on average exposed 2.2 (95% CI 2.01 to 2.4) other HCP andinfected 0.14 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.17) HCP, while patient sources exposed a mean of3.4 (95% CI 2.6 to 4.2) HCP but only infected 0.07 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.11) HCP. Themultivariate analysis demonstrated that exposure to a coworker source carried ahigher risk of testing positive compared with exposure to a patient source (OR3.22; 95% CI 1.72 to 6.04). CONCLUSION: Occupational exposures to coworkersources were not only more frequent but also associated with triple the risk ofdeveloping COVID-19 infection, compared with exposures to patient sources.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, characterised byrespiratory, physical and psychological dysfunctions. Rehabilitation couldeffectively alleviate the symptoms and promote recovery of the physical andmental health of patients with COVID-19. Recently, rehabilitation medicalinstitutions have issued clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and expert consensusstatements involving recommendations for rehabilitation assessments andrehabilitation therapies for COVID-19. This systematic review aims to assess the methodological quality and reporting quality of the guidance documents, evaluate the heterogeneity of the recommendations and summarise the recommendations withrespect to rehabilitation assessments and rehabilitation therapies for COVID-19to provide a quick reference for front-line clinicians, therapists and patientsas well as reasonable suggestions for future guidelines. METHODS AND ANALYSIS:The electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), WanfangDatabase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and websites ofgovernments or organisations (eg, National Guideline Clearinghouse, GuidelinesInternational Network, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and WHO) will be searched foreligible CPGs and expert consensus statements from inception to August 2022. CPGsand expert consensus statements published in Chinese or English and presentingrecommendations for modern functional rehabilitation techniques and/ortraditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation techniques for COVID-19 will beincluded. Reviews, interpretations, old versions of CPGs and expert consensusstatements and those for the management of other diseases during the pandemicwill be excluded. Two reviewers will independently review each article, extractdata, appraise the methodological quality following the Appraisal of Guidelinesfor Research & Evaluation II tool and assess the reporting quality with theReporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare statement. The Measurement Scale of Rate of Agreement will be used to evaluate the heterogeneity of therecommendations in different CPGs and expert consensus statements. Agreementbetween reviewers will be calculated using the intraclass correlationcoefficient. We will also summarise the recommendations for rehabilitation inpatients with COVID-19. The results will be narratively described and presentedas tables or figures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not needed forthis systematic review because information from published documents will be used.The findings will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal andreported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020190761.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic and vitamin D: rising trends in status and in daily amounts of vitamin D provided by supplements.
PG  - e059477
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059477 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there have beenplausible suggestions about the need to augment vitamin D intake bysupplementation in order to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection and reduce mortality.Some groups have advocated supplementation for all adults, but governmentalagencies have advocated targeted supplementation. We sought to explore the effectof the COVID-19 pandemic on both vitamin D status and on the dose ofnew-to-market vitamin D supplements. SETTING: University hospital, Dublin,Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory-based samples of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) (n=100 505). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes: comparing yearly average 25OHD prior to the pandemic (April 2019 to March 2020)with during the pandemic (April 2020 to March 2021) and comparing the dose ofnew-to-market vitamin D supplements between 2017 and 2021 (n=2689). SECONDARYOUTCOME: comparing prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D excess duringthe two time periods. RESULTS: The average yearly serum 25OHD measurementincreased by 2.8 nmol/L (61.4, 95% CI 61.5 to 61.7 vs 58.6, 95% CI 58.4 to 58.9, p<0.001), which was almost threefold higher than two similar trend analyses that we conducted between 1993 and 2016. There was a lower prevalence of low 25OHD anda higher prevalence of high 25OHD. The dose of new-to-market vitamin Dsupplements was higher in the years 2020-2021 compared with the years 2017-2019(p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We showed significant increases in serum 25OHD and in thedose of new-to-market vitamin D supplements. The frequency of low vitamin Dstatus reduced indicating benefit, but the frequency of vitamin D excessincreased indicating risk of harm. Rather than a blanket recommendation aboutvitamin D supplementation for all adults, we recommend a targeted approach ofsupplementation within current governmental guidelines to at-risk groups andcautioning consumers about adverse effects of high dose supplements on themarket.

AB  - Many ethical issues were raised by the pandemic crisis. Caregivers were undergreat pressure and stress in their work in residential care facilities for thedependent elderly (Ehpad), both with residents and their families. Theimplementation of ethical support tools was only gradual, particularly for themanagement of residents' deaths. Anxiety has set in among all the people working or living in the Ehpad, blurring interpersonal relations and increasing tensions and professional exhaustion.

AB  - In 2016, sepsis was newly defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused bya dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis remains one of the crucialmedical problems to be solved worldwide. Although the world health organizationhas made sepsis a global health priority, there remain no specific and effective therapy for sepsis so far. Indeed, over the previous decades almost all attempts to develop novel drugs have failed. This may be partly ascribable to themultifactorial complexity of the septic cascade and the resultant difficulties ofidentifying drug targets. In addition, there might still be missing links amongdysregulated host responses in vital organs. In this review article, recentadvances in understanding of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis aresummarized, with a focus on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), thesignificant role of NETs in thrombosis/embolism, and the functional roles ofplasma proteins, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and inter-alpha-inhibitorproteins (IAIPs). The specific plasma proteins that are markedly decreased in theacute phase of sepsis may play important roles in the regulation of blood cells, vascular endothelial cells and coagulation. The accumulating evidence may provideus with insights into a novel aspect of the pathophysiology of sepsis and septic ARDS, including that in COVID-19.

AB  - The prognosis of patients with severe cases of COVID-19 is poor; thus, biomarkersfor earlier prediction of COVID-19 progression are vital. We measured levels offive lung injury-related biomarkers, SP-D, KL-6, presepsin, kallistatin andstratifin, in serum samples collected serially during hospitalization from 31patients with mild/moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia, and theirpredictive performances were compared. Like the previously reported presepsin, a new biomarker candidate, stratifin, was significantly elevated with the onset of severe or critical symptoms in COVID-19 patients and decreased with symptomimprovement. Notably, changes in stratifin and presepsin levels were distinctlyearlier than those in SP-D, KL-6 and even SpO2/FiO2 values. Furthermore, serumlevels of these biomarkers were significantly higher at the pre-severe stage(before the start of oxygen support) of patients who eventually advanced tosevere/critical stages than in the patients who remained at the mild/moderatestage. These results were confirmed in an independent cohort, including 71mild/moderate and 14 severe/critical patients, for whom the performance ofstratifin and presepsin in discriminating between mild/moderate and pre-severeconditions of COVID-19 patients was superior to that of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio.Therefore, we concluded that stratifin and presepsin could be used as prognostic biomarkers for severe COVID-19 progression.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 on the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) during the early pandemic remains unclear. COVID-19 has become one of the leading causes of global mortality, with a disproportionate impact on persons with CVD. Studies of health facility admissions for CVD found significant decreases during thepandemic. Studies of hospital mortality for CVD were more variable. Studies ofpopulation-level CVD mortality differed across countries, with most showingdecreases, although some revealed increases in deaths. In some countries wherelarge increases in CVD deaths were reported in vital registration systems,misclassification of COVID-19 as CVD may have occurred. Taken together, studiessuggest heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on CVD without largeincreases in CVD mortality in 2020 for a number of countries. Clinical andpopulation science research is needed to examine the ways in which the pandemichas affected CVD burden.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic placed significant global pressure on public health, withthe demand for specialist clinical input, equipment and therapeutics oftenoutweighing supply in many well-established healthcare systems. The UK was noexception to this burden, resulting in unprecedented demands being placed on its NHS. Throughout the pandemic, the UK Defence Medical Services (DMS) aided thecivilian healthcare sector, while concurrently adapting as an organisation tomeet its enduring commitment in promoting the operational output of the wider UK Armed Forces. This paper serves to provide an overview of some of these keyactivities while offering proposed lessons which can be learnt, in order topromote the DMS' output in times of future crises. Of note, the DMS aided tomitigate surge demands placed on the NHS' supply chain, assisting in promotingits resilience to provide key materials to civilian clinical personnel.Adaptation of military policy generation mechanisms, together with adoption ofnovel technological approaches to promote remote working, empowered efficient DMSoperational output throughout the pandemic. Direct provision of personnel toassist in the NHS' clinical output served to foster mutually beneficialinterorganisational relationships, while providing objective benefit for the UKpublic.This paper was selected as the BMJ Military Health Royal Society ofMedicine Colt Foundation National Essay Prize Winner 2021.

TI  - Disruption to the doctor-patient relationship in primary care: a qualitativestudy.
LID - BJGPO.2022.0039 [pii]
LID - 10.3399/BJGPO.2022.0039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Starfield describes importance of system-level components of primary care (first-contact, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated), on countries'health systems. We postulate at the individual-level, interpersonal interactions and relationship-centred care are central to primary care. AIM: Explore impact ofCOVID-19 on disruption to doctor-patient relationship and subsequent development of new models of care. DESIGN & SETTING: Series of 11 cross-sectional 'surveys ofNew Zealand urban and rural primary care doctors, nurses and managers, May 2020to February 2021, to understand and monitor responses to pandemic. METHOD: Using inductive content analysis, cumulated qualitative data from doctors was examined through the lenses of doctor-patient relationship, its disruption and resultingchanges in models of care. RESULTS: 1519 responses representing 482 uniqueparticipants, 86% doctors. Four key themes of move to transactionalconsultations; task shifting with team changes; creating a production line; anddiminished communication and coordination across services emerged. CONCLUSION:Advent of pandemic led to severe and ongoing strain on practices requiring rapid change to model of care. Team members took on new roles for triaging, testing andseparating respiratory from non-respiratory patients. Rapid move to telehealth,with policies developed on where face-to-face consultations necessary. Practicestrain exacerbated by disruption to coordination with secondary and otherreferral services. As new models of general practice develop, further disruptionsto development of doctor-patients relationships must be avoided. This workextends Starfield's system-level paradigm to the individual level with the corevalue of primary care the doctor-patient relationship. Successful sustainablemodels likely to be where relationships are centralised.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-small-cell lung cancer pathologic stageand presentation.
PG  - E496-E503
LID - 10.1503/cjs.016721 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is believed that the cessation of normative cancer care servicesduring the COVID-19 pandemic may be resulting in pathologic upstaging and higher long-term mortality rates. We aimed to understand how the pandemic has affectedour patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Weconducted a single-centre retrospective analysis to assess how the COVID-19pandemic has affected patient referrals, pathologic stage of NSCLC, mortalityrates and surgical procedures at our cancer care centre in Ontario, Canada. Atour centre, physicians advocated for and followed recommendations that operationsin cancer patients should be among the last procedures to be delayed. Patientswere included if they were aged 18 years or older, were not receiving palliative care, and had been screened, diagnosed and treated for NSCLC (primary tumours).We compared outcomes between a prepandemic period (January 2019 to February 2020)and a period during the pandemic (March 2020 to February 2021). RESULTS: A total of 695 patients were included for statistical analysis, of whom 650 underwentsurgery. There was no statistically significant difference in any of the outcomesof interest between patients seen before (n = 330) and during (n = 320) thepandemic. CONCLUSION: Cancer care services at our centre were maintained duringthe COVID-19 pandemic, and potential adverse effects on prognosis and survivalthat have been seen in other countries were avoided. The results inform healthcare providers how the effects of future pandemics can be blunted by usingproactive preservative strategies and surgeon advocacy.

AB  - Human milk is important for antimicrobial defense in infants and has welldemonstrated antiviral activity. We evaluated the protective ability of humanmilk against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection in a human fetal intestinal cell culture model. We found that, in this model, human milk blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication, irrespective of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies. Complete inhibition of both envelopedMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human respiratory syncytialvirus infections was also observed, whereas no inhibition of non-envelopedenterovirus A71 infection was seen. Transcriptome analysis after 24 h of theintestinal monolayers treated with human milk showed large transcriptomic changesfrom human milk treatment, and subsequent analysis suggested that ATP1A1down-regulation by milk might be of importance. Inhibition of ATP1A1 blockedSARS-CoV-2 infection in our intestinal model, whereas no effect on EV-A71infection was seen. Our data indicate that human milk has potent antiviralactivity against particular (enveloped) viruses by potentially blocking theATP1A1-mediated endocytic process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to understand the socioeconomic and physicalactivity impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children living with perinatallyacquired HIV (PHIV) and without HIV (HIV-) in Kampala (Uganda). METHODS: Theauthors included children aged 10-18 years who filled out questionnaires atbaseline (2017-2018, prepandemic) and 2 years later (March 2020-January 2021,pandemic) in an observational cohort study at Joint Clinical Research Centre(Kampala). Physical activity energy expenditure was calculated using a youthcompendium from the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research.Descriptive and standard test statistics including Kruskal-Wallis were used.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight children from Kampala Uganda were included prepandemic (101 PHIV and 97 HIV-); 131 (71 PHIV and 60 HIV-) had informationcollected during the pandemic. At baseline, median and interquartile range agewas 13 years (11; 15), and 52% were females. During the pandemic, overall weekly physical activity increased by a median of 854 minutes (interquartile range:270-1890), and energy expenditures increased by 16% in both PHIV and in HIV- (P <.001 for groups overall prepandemic vs pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: The authors found in this Ugandan cohort of children that children engaged in more physicalactivity. Further research is warranted to understand the long-term effects ofthe pandemic on children's well-being.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The anxiety disorders are the most prevalentmental health condition, and anxiety is considered the sixth cause of disability surpassing diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, andosteoarthritis. Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an increase in the numberof psychiatric diseases diagnosis in all social layers around the world. About55%-94% of patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders are treated withbenzodiazepines, meanwhile benzodiazepines can promote several adverse effects.In this way, alternative therapies, such as essential oils may offer significant benefits in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. However, theanxiolytic effect of these essential oils must be proper evaluated appropriate aswell as the suitable dosage and side effect need further research. AIM OF THESTUDY: The aim was to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of Roman chamomile (Anthemisnobilis L.) and tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco) essential oils using thelight-dark test in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bothessential oils were analyzed by GC-MS and the major compounds were identified.The anxiolytic effect was evaluated by light-dark test in adult zebrafish.RESULTS: The results showed that roman chamomile essential oil has anxiolyticeffect in adult zebrafish, whereas tangerine essential oil tends to reduceanxiety The major compounds of tangerine essential oil were limonene andgamma-terpinene, and the major compounds of roman chamomile werepentadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, hexadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, 1-piperidinoland trans-1-ethyl-3-methyl-cyclopentane. CONCLUSIONS: The present studydemonstrated that this anxiolytic effect may be attributed to the synergisticeffect of the compounds present in roman chamomile essential oil, particularlythe major compounds. The roman chamomile essential oil at the highestconcentration showed anxiolytic effect. The tangerine essential oil showed atendency to reduce anxiety, but it was not statistically significative. Inaddition, roman chamomile and tangerine essential oils did not cause causealteration in locomotion activity and exploratory ability of the fish.

AB  - The 2021 Annual Safety Pharmacology (SP) Society (SPS) meeting was held virtuallyOctober 4-8, 2021 due to the continuing COVID-19 global pandemic. This themedissue of J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods comprises articles arising from the meeting.As in previous years the manuscripts reflect various areas of innovation in SPincluding a perspective on aging and its impact on drug attrition during safetyassessments, an integrated assessment of respiratory, cardiovascular and animalactivity of in vivo nonclinical studies, development of a dynamic QT-ratecorrection method in primates, evaluation of the "comprehensive in vitroproarrhythmia assay" (CiPA) ion channel protocol to the automated patch clamp,and best practices regarding the conduct of hERG electrophysiology studies and ananalysis of secondary pharmacology assays by the FDA. The meeting also generated 85 abstracts (reproduced in the current volume of J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods).It appears that the validation of methods remains a challenge in SP.Nevertheless, the continued efforts to mine approaches to detection ofproarrhythmia liability remains a baffling obsession given the ability ofIndustry to completely prevent drugs entering into clinical study only to befound to have proarrhythmic properties, with no reports of such for at least ten years. Perhaps it is time to move on from CiPA and find genuine problems tosolve?

AB  - Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which are pivotalsensors of RNA virus invasions, mediate the transcriptional induction of genesencoding type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, successfullyestablishing host antiviral immune response. A few excellent reviews haveelaborated on the structural biology of RLRs and the antiviral mechanisms of RLR activation. In this review, we give a basic understanding of RLR biology andsummarize recent findings of how RLR signaling cascade is strictly controlled by host regulatory mechanisms, which include RLR-interacting proteins,post-translational modifications and microRNAs (miRNAs). Furthermore, we payparticular attention to the relationship between RLRs and diseases, especiallyhow RLRs participate in SARS-CoV-2, malaria or bacterial infections, howsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or mutations in RLRs and antibodiesagainst RLRs lead to autoinflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases, and howRLRs are involved in anti-tumor immunity. These findings will provide insightsand guidance for antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies targeting RLRs.

AB  - Viral infectious diseases have various neurological manifestations, whether they are epidemic or pandemic in nature. Nonspecific encephalopathy is the most commoncentral nervous system (CNS) manifestation. The spectrum of nervous evidencevaries for viral pathogens. Some infectious viruses, such as the Ebola virus,exhibit direct neurotropism. Others, such as the Rift Valley fever virus, havethe potential for neurotropism. Direct neurotropism is unknown in monkeypoxvirus, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and even smallpox. As seen in the COVID-19, theremay be evidence of para-infectious neurological syndrome. There have only been a few reports of neurological diseases caused by monkeypox infection. Futureefforts to prevent the spread of infectious disease surges can reduce mortalitycomplications, the therapeutic burden on the health-care system, and preventfurther spread. This study describes the clinical and neurological complications of monkeypox infection, particularly encephalitis, as well as the laboratorydiagnosis of these cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Immunocompromised patients have an increased risk of severe form ofCOVID-19. The clinical efficacy of the tixagevimab/cilgavimab monoclonal antibodycombination as pre-exposure prophylaxis against BA.1 and BA.2 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages is unknown. We aimed to describe the incidence and outcomes ofCOVID-19 among immunocompromised patients receiving tixagevimab/cilgavimab aspreexposure prophylaxis, during the Omicron wave in France. METHODS: This is anobservational multicentre cohort study of immunocompromised patients receivingtixagevimab/cilgavimab as preexposure prophylaxis between December 28(th), 2021, and March 31(st), 2022. Patients received tixagevimab/cilgavimab 150/150 mgintramuscularly if they had impaired vaccine response, and a high risk of severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Tixagevimab/cilgavimab was administered to 1112immunocompromised patients. After a median [range] follow-up of 63 [49-73] days, COVID-19 was confirmed in 49/1112 (4.4%) at least 5 days following treatment.During the study period, mean weekly incidence rate was 1669 in 100,000inhabitants in Ile-de-France and 530 in 100,000 among patients who receivedtixagevimab/cilgavimab prophylaxis. Among infected patients, 43/49 (88%) had amild-to moderate form and 6/49 (12%) had a moderate-to-severe form of COVID-19.Patients with moderate-to-severe illnesses were less likely to have receivedearly therapies than patients with mild forms (53.5% vs. 16.7% respectively) and 2/49 (4%) patients died from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a low rate of infections and severe illnesses among immunocompromised patients treated with tixagevimab/cilgavimab. A global preventive strategy including vaccines,preexposure prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies, and early therapies might be effective to prevent severe forms of COVID-19 among severely immunocompromisedpatients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the function of patients with COVID-19 admitted to anacute care hospital early in the pandemic and to characterize change in function among those admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and to non-critical careservices. DESIGN: This descriptive, retrospective cohort study examined patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a tertiary care medical center during thefirst wave of the pandemic in 2020. Included patients were stratified into fourcohorts based on whether or not they received therapy during theirhospitalization and whether or not their hospitalization included time in theintensive care unit (ICU). Data on demographics, functional impairments, medical interventions, and functional outcomes were collected. SETTING: HospitalPARTICIPANTS: : 432 adult patients were included in this study. RESULTS: ICUpatients receiving therapy were more likely to have impaired cognition, impaired strength, and impaired sensation than non-ICU patients receiving therapy.Patients made improvements from evaluation to discharge on the Functional Status Score for the ICU, AM-PAC Daily Activity, and AM-PAC Basic Mobility Short Forms. CONCLUSION: Patients admitted with COVID-19 experienced significant functionalimpairments, but also demonstrated improvement during the course of theirhospitalizations. This study can facilitate healthcare provider awareness of the detrimental functional impacts of COVID-19 and the potential role ofrehabilitation services for these patients.

AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but 3 of 4 USadults do not have their blood pressure adequately controlled. Million Hearts (USDepartment of Health and Human Services) is a national initiative that promotes aset of priorities and interventions to optimize delivery of evidence-basedstrategies to manage cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. The COVID-19pandemic, however, has disrupted routine care and preventive service delivery. Weidentified examples of clinical and health organizations that adapted servicesand care processes to continue a focus on monitoring and controlling hypertensionduring the pandemic. Eight Hypertension Control Exemplars were identified andinterviewed. They reported various adapted care strategies includingtelemedicine, engaging patients in self-measured blood pressure monitoring,adapting or implementing medication management services, activating partnerships to respond to patient needs or expand services, and implementing unique patientoutreach approaches. Documenting these hypertension control strategies can helpincrease adoption of adaptive approaches during public health emergencies androutine care.

TI  - Impact of the COVID 19 Pandemic on Treatment of nAMD via a Portal-BasedCollaboration.
LID - 10.1055/a-1806-2474 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Under the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic and the lockdown inGermany, there were significantly fewer consultations in almost all medicaldisciplines. Especially given the need for consistent treatment and follow-up of nAMD patients, this can have far-reaching consequences for visual function,especially in elderly patients. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of nAMDpatients, the number of visits (IVI or follow-up), OCTs or IVIs performed and themean worst visual acuity for the period before and after the first COVID19-associated lockdown were compared in a portal-based collaboration of 50 eyecare practices. Patients were treated according to the pro re nata (PRN) regimen that included intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors based on activitycriteria in the OCT follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 34,660 visits from 55 monthswere included in the analysis. Before lockdown (16 March 2020), an average of81.8% +/- 2.1% of patients were regularly checked or treated (every 4 to 5weeks). With the onset of lockdown, the proportion of patients receiving optimum treatment dropped to 64.0%. Initially, the proportion of OCT follow-ups decreasedfrom 48.4% to 30.9% and, with a delay, the proportion of injections decreasedfrom 57.5% to 45.8%. This was also reflected in the number of OCT follow-ups:15.5 before, 11.4 during and 17.2 after lockdown (p < 0.001). In 29% of cases, anindividual worsening of visual acuity by more than 0.1 logMAR after the end ofthe lockdown compared to before the lockdown could be observed. On average, mean visual acuity decreased significantly by 0.054 logMAR (p < 10(-11)). Thissignificant impairment was not reversed again during the remaining observationperiod, although the number of visits, OCT examinations and IVIs in the following12 months were at the pre-lockdown level. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic-relatedlockdown resulted in unintended treatment breaks in nAMD patients receiving IVItherapy. The decrease in visits as well as in IVIs caused a loss of visualfunction in the observed cohort. The consistent treatment regimen of nAMDpatients was resumed shortly after the lockdown with an immediate normalizationof the number of OCT examinations and IVIs. However, a permanent loss of visualfunction was observed, and this did not improve within a year after the lockdown.This finding highlights the importance of better case management, leading toimproved patient adherence in the event of further waves of COVID or otherpandemics.

TI  - Discovery and Mechanistic Study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PafA Inhibitors.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00289 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and isranked as the second killer infectious disease after COVID-19. Proteasomeaccessory factor A (PafA) is considered an attractive target because of its lowsequence conservation in humans and its role in virulence. In this study, wedesigned a mutant of Mtb PafA that enabled large-scale purification of activePafA. Using a devised high-throughput screening assay, two PafA inhibitors werediscovered. ST1926 inhibited Mtb PafA by binding in the Pup binding groove, butit was less active against Corynebacterium glutamicum PafA because theST1926-binding residues are not conserved. Bithionol bound to the conservedATP-binding pocket, thereby, inhibits PafA in an ATP-competitive manner. BothST1926 and bithionol inhibited the growth of an attenuated Mtb strain (H37Ra) at micromolar concentrations. Our work thus provides new tools for tuberculosisresearch and a foundation for future PafA-targeted drug development for treating tuberculosis.

AB  - Heterologous vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides arational strategy to rapidly increase vaccination coverage in many regions of theworld. Although data regarding messenger RNA (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 vaccinecombinations are available, there is limited information about the combination ofthese platforms with other vaccines widely used in developing countries, such as BBIBP-CorV and Sputnik V. Here, we assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicityof 15 vaccine combinations in 1,314 participants. We evaluate immunoglobulin G(IgG) anti-spike response and virus neutralizing titers and observe that a numberof heterologous vaccine combinations are equivalent or superior to homologousschemes. For all cohorts in this study, the highest antibody response is induced by mRNA-1273 as the second dose. No serious adverse events are detected in any ofthe schedules analyzed. Our observations provide rational support for the use of different vaccine combinations to achieve wide vaccine coverage in the shortestpossible time.

AB  - Recent biochemical, biophysical, and genetic studies have shown that heparansulfate, a major component of the cellular glycocalyx, participates in infection of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating the so-called open conformation of the spikeprotein, which is required for binding to ACE2. This review highlights theinvolvement of heparan sulfate in the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle and argues that there is a high degree of coordination between host cell heparan sulfate andasparagine-linked glycans on the spike in enabling ACE2 binding and subsequentinfection. The discovery that spike protein binding and infection depends on bothviral and host glycans provides insights into the evolution, spread and potentialtherapies for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic created major challenges across society,healthcare provision and also for those delivering healthcare educationprogrammes. Clinical placements were disrupted and, in many incidences cancelled.Higher education institutions were required to move completely to online deliverymethods with little notice. This created significant additional workload, stress and the need to learn new skills at a time of great uncertainty. This studyexplored the risks of burnout in academic radiographers during the first 12months of the pandemic. METHODS: A survey was circulated using SurveyMonkey viapersonal, national and international networks, including the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS), to reach as many academic radiographers aspossible. Disengagement and exhaustion were measured using the Oldenburg burnout inventory. Descriptive statistics and a one-way ANOVA were used to analyse thequantitative data using STATA V16 (Statacorp, TA). RESULTS: 533 academicradiographers responded to the survey from 43 different countries. Meandisengagement was in the medium range and exhaustion was high for the totaldataset. In a subset of countries with 10 or more responses, there wassignificant variation between countries, with the UK having highest meanexhaustion score and the UK, Ireland and France sharing the highest meandisengagement score. In the total dataset, 86% agreed workload had increasedduring the pandemic and 35% had considered leaving academia in the last year.CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the stark reality of the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic on academic radiographers' workload, wellbeing, and intentionto leave their roles. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: COVID-19 has had a significantimpact on academic radiographers and this study highlights the urgent need forremedial measures to better support academic radiographers in order to ensure asufficient, and sustainable workforce.

AB  - Based on the growing literature on the link between government policy and mental health, this article proposes a socio-ecological model to understand the wayimmigration policy and law enforcement specifically have become a key determinantof mental health among undocumented immigrants and their families. Based on thelatest research on the subject, the article organizes and defines the spiral thatgoes from the main features of governmental immigration policy and lawenforcement to the stressors they generate among the migrant community and mentalhealth outcomes among different groups within it. It also considers the copingmechanisms migrants adopt to deal with their legal vulnerability, classifyingthem into those which worsen mental health outcomes and some which,paradoxically, make migrant communities resilient.

AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is drawing increasing attention as apromising tool for an early warning of emerging infectious diseases such asCOVID-19. This study demonstrated the utility of a spatial bisection method (SBM)and a global optimization algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm, GA), to supportbetter designing and operating a WBE program for disease surveillance and source identification. The performances of SBM and GA were compared in determining theoptimal locations of sewer monitoring manholes to minimize the difference amongthe effective spatial monitoring scales of the selected manholes. While GA wasmore flexible in determining the spatial resolution of the monitoring areas, SBM allows stepwise selection of optimal sampling manholes with equiarealsubcatchments and lowers computational cost. Upon detecting disease outbreaks at a regular sewer monitoring site, additional manholes within the catchment can be selected and monitored to identify source areas with a required spatialresolution. SBM offered an efficient method for rapidly searching for the optimallocations of additional sampling manholes to identify the source areas. Thisstudy provides strategic and technical elements of WBE including sampling siteselection with required spatial resolution and a source identification method.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica (GCA/PMR) represent independent risk factors for worse outcomes in COVID-19.METHODS: Observational, national, French, multicenter cohort (NCT04353609)comprising patients aged >/=18 years with confirmed diagnoses of either GCA, PMR or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) having presented COVID-19; those under rituximabwere excluded. Primary endpoint was COVID-19 severity in GCA/PMR patients ascompared to RA. We also aimed to describe the evolution of GCA/PMR patientsfollowing COVID-19. Multinomial logistic regression models were performed, withand without adjustment on pre-specified confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, bodymass index, arterial hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease).Unadjusted and adjusted multinomial odds-ratio (OR/aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as effect size using RA as reference group.RESULTS: Between April 15, 2020, and August 20, 2021, 674 patients [45 (6.6%)GCA, 47 (7.0%) PMR, 582 (86.4%) RA; 62.8 years, 73.2% female] were included.Compared to RA patients, those with GCA/PMR were older and more frequentlypresented hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Severe COVID-19 and death occurred in 24 (26.1%) and 16 (17.8%) patients with GCA/PMR, respectively. Unadjusted analyses revealed higher odds of severe COVID-19 [OR = 3.32 (95% CI1.89-5.83; p < 0.001)] and death [OR = 3.20 (95%CI 1.67-6.13; p < 0.001)] forGCA/PMR compared to RA. After model adjustment, these odds were attenuated.CONCLUSION: Patients with GCA/PMR were more likely to have severe COVID-19 andhigher mortality compared to those with RA. This worse prognosis is mostly due towell known risk factors for the general population rather than vasculitis per se.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes ofbarotrauma (pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema) in mechanicallyventilated COVID-19 patients. To describe the chest radiography patterns ofbarotrauma and understand the development in relation to mechanical ventilationand patient mortality. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 363patients with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 8, 2020. Primary outcomes werepneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema with or without pneumothorax,pneumoperitoneum, or pneumoretroperitoneum. The secondary outcomes were length ofintubation and death. In patients with pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneousemphysema, we conducted an imaging review to determine the timeline of barotraumadevelopment. RESULTS: Forty three out of 363 (12%) patients developed barotrauma radiographically. The median time to development of either pneumomediastinum orsubcutaneous emphysema was 2 days (IQR 1.0-4.5) after intubation and the mediantime to pneumothorax was 7 days (IQR 2.0-10.0). The overall incidence ofpneumothorax was 28/363 (8%) with an incidence of 17/43 (40%) in the barotraumacohort and 11/320 (3%) in those without barotrauma (p </= 0.001). In total,257/363 (71%) patients died with an increase in mortality in those withbarotrauma 33/43 (77%) vs. 224/320 (70%). When adjusting for covariates,barotrauma was associated with increased odds of death (OR 2.99, 95% CI1.25-7.17). CONCLUSION: Barotrauma is a frequent complication of mechanicallyventilated COVID-19 patients. In comparison to intubated COVID-19 patientswithout barotrauma, there is a higher rate of pneumothorax and an increased risk of death.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT), prior to the COVID pandemic, was rare representing 0.5 of all strokes, with the diagnosis made by MRI or CTvenography.(1-,3) COVID-19 patients compared to general populations have a 30-60 times greater risk of CVT compared to non-affected populations, and up to a thirdof severe COVID patients may have thrombotic complications.(4-8) Currently,vaccines are the best way to prevent severe COVID-19. In February 2021, reportsof CVT and Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) related toadenovirus viral vector vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine(AZD1222 (ChAdOx1)) and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine (JNJ-78436735(Ad26.COV2.S)), were noted, with a 1/583,000 incidence from Johnson and Johnsonvaccine in the United States.(11, 12) This study retrospectively analyzed CVT andcross-sectional venography at an Eastern Medical Center from 2018 to 2021, andpresents radiographic examples of CVT and what is learned from the immuneresponse. METHODS: After IRB approval, a retrospective review of cross-sectional CTV and MRVs from January 1st 2018 to April 30th 2021, at a single health system was performed. Indications, vaccine status, patient age, sex, and positivefinding incidence were specifically assessed during March and April for eachyear. A multivariable-adjusted trends analysis using Poisson regression estimatedvenogram frequencies and multivariable logistic regression compared sex, age,indications and vaccination status. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2021, (Fig. 1), a total of n = 2206 in patient and emergency roomcross-sectional venograms were obtained, with 322 CTVs and 1884 MRVs. In 2018,2019, 2020, respective totals of cross-sectional venograms were 568, 657, 660,compared to 321 cross-sectional venograms in the first four months of 2021. CTVin 2018, 2019, 2020, respective totals were 51, 86, 97, MRV totals were 517, 571,563, compared to the 2021 first four month totals of 88 CTVs and 233 MRVs. March,April 2018, 2019, 2020, CTVs respectively were 6, 17, 11, compared to the 2021first four months of 59 CTVs, comprising 63% of the total 93 CTVs, respectiveMRVs were 79, 97, 52, compared to 143 MRVs in the first four months of 2021 for39% of the total 371 MRVs. In March, April 2020 during the pandemic onset,cross-sectional imaging at the East Coast Medical Center decreased, as prioritieswere on maintaining patient ventilation, high level of care and limiting spreadof disease. In March/April 2021, reports of VITT and CVT likely contributed toincreased CTVs and MRVs, of 39.65% [1.20-1.63] increase (P < 0.001) from prior.In March, April 2021 of 202 venograms obtained, 158 (78.2.%) were unvaccinatedpatients, 16 positive for CVT (10.1%), 44 were on vaccinated patients (21.7%), 8 specifically ordered with vaccination as a clinical indication, 2 positive forCVT (4.5%), (odds ratio = 0.52 [0.12-2.38], p = 0.200). CONCLUSION: CTV prior to the COVID pandemic, was rare, responsible for 0.5 of all strokes, at the onset ofthe pandemic in the East Coast, overall cross-sectional imaging volumes declined due to maintaining ventilation, high levels of care and limiting disease spread, although COVID-19 patients have a 30-60 times greater risk of CVT compared to thegeneral population, and vaccination is currently the best option to mitigatesevere disease. In early 2021, reports of adenoviral vector COVID vaccinescausing CTV and VITT, led to at 39.65% increase in cross-sectional venography,however, in this study unvaccinated patients in 2021 had higher incidence of CVT (10.1%), compared to the vaccinated patients (4.5%). Clinicians should be awarethat VITT CVT may present with a headache 5-30 days post-vaccination withthrombosis best diagnosed on CTV or MRV. If thrombosis is present withthrombocytopenia, platelets <150 x 10(9), elevated D-Dimer >4000 FEU, andpositive anti-PF4 ELISA assay, the diagnosis is definitive.(13) VITT CVTresembles spontaneous autoimmune heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and ispostulated to occur from platelet factor 4 (PF4) binding to vaccine adenoviralvectors forming a novel antigen, anti-PF4 memory B-cells and anti-PF4 (VITT)antibodies.(14-17).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The relationship that vaccination against corona virus disease 19(COVID-19) or recovery from the acute form of the illness may have with theincidence or severity of acute appendicitis (AA) has not been explored. The aimof this study was to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A single centreretrospective study of all consecutive adult patients presenting with AA in the 6mo after the initiation of a national vaccination program was performed. Thepresenting characteristics and pathological data of patients who had either been vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19 were compared with those who hadnot. In addition, historical data from the equivalent period 12 and 24 mobeforehand was also extracted. The incidence of AA was compared between each ofthese time-frames. RESULTS: Of the 258 patients initially identified, 255 wereincluded in the analysis of which 156 had either been vaccinated and/or recoveredfrom COVID-19 (61.2%) whilst 99 (38.8%) patients had not. When comparing thesetwo groups, there were no significant differences in the presentingcharacteristics, operative findings or postoperative courses. There was also nosignificant change in the incidence of AA when comparing the study dates withhistorical data (median weekly incidence of AA 8.0 versus 8.0 versus 8.0respectively, P = 0.672). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data presented here, wefailed to find a relationship between a national vaccination program and both thenature and incidence of AA presenting to a busy urban hospital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We explore injecting risk and HIV incidence among PWID in New YorkCity (NYC), from 2012 to 2019, when incidence was extremely low, <0.1/100person-years at risk, and during disruption of prevention services due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We developed an Agent-Based model (ABM) to simulatesharing injecting equipment and measure HIV incidence in NYC. The model wasadapted from a previous ABM model developed to compare HIV transmission with"high" versus "low" dead space syringes. Data for applying the model to NYCduring the period of very low HIV incidence was taken from the "Risk Factors"study, a long-running study of participants entering substance use treatment inNYC. Injecting risk behavior had not been eliminated in this population, withapproximately 15 % reported recent syringe sharing. Data for possibletransmission during COVID-19 disruption was taken from previous HIV outbreaks andearly studies of the pandemic in NYC. RESULTS: The modeled incidence rates fellwithin the 95 % confidence bounds of all of the empirically observed incidencerates, without any additional calibration of the model. Potential COVID-19disruptions increased the probability of an outbreak from 0.03 to 0.25.CONCLUSIONS: The primary factors in the very low HIV incidence were the extremelysmall numbers of PWID likely to transmit HIV and that most sharing occurs within small, relatively stable, mostly seroconcordant groups. Containing an HIVoutbreak among PWID during a continuing pandemic would be quite difficult.Pre-pandemic levels of HIV prevention services should be restored as quickly asfeasible.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the thoughts of preschool children andtheir mothers about COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS: This qualitative study wasdescriptive phenomenology design. Data were collected and analyzed throughindividual interviews from 26 people (13 mothers and 13 children) using aPersonal Information Form and an Interview Form.After the thematic analysis, fourmain themes were created for the children and their mothers. RESULTS: The mainthemes created for mothers and children were: "Effects of the COVID-19 pandemicprocess, Protection, Family relations, Perspective of healthcare staff". TheCOVID-19 pandemic has affected the physical, psycho-social, and economic health, spirituality and family relationships of mothers. It became evident that childrenknew the terms related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Children dreamt of activitiesthey missed and stated that at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, they would go tothe park, the pool, shopping centers, to school, and on vacation. Most of themothers and children followed the rules of protection. In addition, mothers andchildren stated that their perspectives on healthcarestaff changed positivelyafter the pandemic started. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that COVID-19 affectsindividuals bio-psycho-socially, it is crucial for health professionals to knowthe thoughts of individuals, families and children about COVID-19 to increasetheir awareness of potential problems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular processes associated with cellular regulatoryprograms in patients with COVID-19, including gene activation or repressionmediated by epigenetic mechanisms. We hypothesized that a comprehensive geneexpression profiling of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells might expand ourunderstanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of severe COVID-19. METHODS: We usedsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) profiling of ciliated cells (n = 12,725)from healthy controls (SARS-CoV-2 negative n = 13) and patients withmild/moderate (n = 13) and severe (n = 14) COVID-19. ScRNAseq data at the patientlevel were used to perform gene set and pathway enrichment analyses. Weprioritized candidate miRNA-target interactions and epigenetic mechanisms.RESULTS: We found that mild/moderate COVID-19 compared to healthy controls hadupregulation of gene expression signatures associated with mitochondrialfunction, misfolded proteins, and membrane permeability. In addition, we foundthat compared to mild/moderate disease, severe COVID-19 had downregulation ofepigenetic mechanisms, including DNA and histone H3K4 methylation and chromatinremodelling regulation. Furthermore, we found 11-ranked miRNAs that may explainmiRNA-dependent regulation of histone methylation, some of which share seedsequences with SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our results may provide novelinsights into the epigenetic mechanisms mediating the clinical course ofSARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - One of the many outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic was a shift in the delivery of elementary (primary) education. Schools transitioned swiftly to e-learning andprioritized education that was already or could be easily adapted to virtualformats. Given the paucity of online content available, it is not likely thatchild sexual abuse (CSA) prevention education was prioritized. Given that CSAprevention education has demonstrated success in increasing knowledge, protectivebehaviors, and disclosures, and the potential long-term need for e-learningoptions, there is a demand for an exploration of how CSA prevention can beimplemented using e-learning strategies. In the current discussion, we explorehow school-based CSA prevention education could be implemented in a "new normal" context of e-learning. We first present the existing e-learning content for CSAprevention education. We then describe how best practices for preventioneducation can be applied to e-learning. Finally, we present considerations forthe use of e-learning specifically for CSA prevention education. In short,implementing CSA prevention programs through e-learning offers many affordancesfor program accessibility and reach, flexibility in implementation andopportunities for greater exposure to content, and a wide range of ways todemonstrate effective skills and engage children in cycles of practice andfeedback. E-learning, may also, however, limit important conversations betweenchildren and trained instructors that lead to disclosures. The extant literature leaves us unsure as to whether implementing CSA prevention programs throughe-learning will result in better or worse outcomes for children. However, giventhe increasing demand for e-learning options, and the promise of some newe-learning programs, further research on the effectiveness of e-learning CSAprevention programs is warranted.

TI  - Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein onPolystyrene Surface.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00562 [doi]
AB  - A prominent feature of coronaviruses is the presence of a large glycoproteinspike (S) protruding from the viral particle. The specific interactions of amaterial with S determine key aspects such as its possible role for indirecttransmission or its suitability as a virucidal material. Here, we considerall-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction between a polymersurface (polystyrene) and S in its up and down conformations. Polystyrene is acommonly used plastic found in electronics, toys, and many other common objects. Also, previous atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments showed substantialadhesion of S over polystyrene, stronger than in other common materials. Ourresults show that the main driving forces for the adsorption of the S proteinover polystyrene were hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions with S amino acids andglycans. The interaction was stronger for the case of S in the up conformation,which exposes one highly flexible receptor binding domain (RBD) that adjusts its conformation to interact with the polymer surface. In this case, the interaction has similar contributions from the RBD and glycans. In the case of S in the down conformation, the interaction with the polystyrene surface was weaker and it was dominated by glycans located near the RBD. We do not find significant structural changes in the conformation of S, a result which is in deep contrast to ourprevious results with another hydrophobic surface (graphite). Our results suggestthat SARS-CoV-2 virions may adsorb strongly over plastic surfaces withoutsignificantly affecting their infectivity.

TI  - Safety of Booster Doses of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine inPregnancy in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004889 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and summarize reports to the Vaccine Adverse EventReporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system, in pregnantpeople who received a booster dose of mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)vaccine. METHODS: We searched VAERS for U.S. reports of adverse events inpregnant people who received a booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine fromSeptember 22, 2021, to March 24, 2022. Clinicians reviewed reports and available medical records. RESULTS: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System received 323reports of adverse events in pregnant people who received a booster dose ofCOVID-19 vaccine; 178 (55.1%) after BNT162b2 from Pfizer-BioNTech and 145 (44.9%)after mRNA-1273 from Moderna. Seventy-two (22.3%) reports were coded as serious. One neonatal death was reported, but no maternal deaths occurred.Pregnancy-specific outcomes included 56 (17.3%) spontaneous abortions (before 20 weeks of gestation), eight (2.5%) episodes of vaginal bleeding, five (1.5%)stillbirths (at or after 20 weeks of gestation), four (1.2%) episodes ofpreeclampsia, and two (0.6%) preterm deliveries. Reporting rates for stillbirthand preterm delivery were below background rates. Ten instances of adverse eventsin neonates were reported, which included two reports of birth defects.Non-pregnancy-specific adverse events (n=207; 64.1%) were mostly systemic (eg,headache, fatigue) and local reactions and occurred in proportions comparablewith those seen in pregnant people who received the primary COVID-19 vaccination series and reported to VAERS during the same period. CONCLUSION: Review ofreports after a booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant people in VAERSfound their safety profile was comparable with that of published reports afterprimary COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant people.

TI  - Pulmonary Surfactant Proteins are Inhibited by IgA Autoantibodies in SevereCOVID-19.
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202201-0011OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to acute respiratorydistress syndrome with fatal outcomes. Evidence suggests that dysregulated immuneresponses, including autoimmunity, are key pathogenic factors. OBJECTIVES: Toassess whether IgA autoantibodies target lung-specific proteins and contribute todisease severity. METHODS: We collected 147 blood, 9 lung tissue, and 36bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from three tertiary hospitals in Switzerlandand one in Germany. Severe COVID-19 was defined by the need to administer oxygen.We investigated the presence of IgA autoantibodies and their effects on pulmonarysurfactant in COVID-19 using the following methods: immunofluorescence on tissue samples, immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry on bronchoalveolarlavage fluid samples, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on blood samples, andsurface tension measurements with medical surfactant. MEASUREMENTS AND MAINRESULTS: IgA autoantibodies targeting pulmonary surfactant proteins B and C were elevated in patients with severe COVID-19, but not in patients with influenza or bacterial pneumonia. Notably, pulmonary surfactant failed to reduce surfacetension after incubation with either plasma or purified IgA from patients withsevere COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with severe COVID-19harbor IgA against pulmonary surfactant proteins B and C and that theseantibodies block the function of lung surfactant, potentially contributing toalveolar collapse and poor oxygenation.

AB  - Intermittently, the concept of herd immunity has been a potent, if sometimesambiguous and controversial, means of framing the global response to the COVID-19pandemic and envisaging its end. Realizing the full meaning of human herdimmunity requires further attention to its connections after World War I withBritish social theory. Distracted by "obvious" yet unsubstantiatedcorrespondences with veterinary research, historians of the concept have notengaged with the more proximate influence of discussions of social psychology andgroup dynamics on postwar epidemiology. Understanding the openness of early 20th century epidemiology to social thought deepens our appreciation of thesignificance of herd or population immunity, as well as suggests new avenues for exchange between public health and contemporary social sciences.

AB  - In response to rapidly changing societal conditions stemming from the COVID-19pandemic, we summarize data sources with potential to produce timely andspatially granular measures of physical, economic, and social conditions relevantto public health surveillance, and we briefly describe emerging analytic methods to improve small-area estimation. To inform this article, we reviewed publishedsystematic review articles set in the United States from 2015 to 2020 andconducted unstructured interviews with senior content experts in public heathpractice, academia, and industry. We identified a modest number of data sourceswith high potential for generating timely and spatially granular measures ofphysical, economic, and social determinants of health. We also summarizedmodeling and machine-learning techniques useful to support development oftime-sensitive surveillance measures that may be critical for responding tofuture major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Supporting Emergent Bilinguals Who Use Augmentative and Alternative Communicationand Their Families: Lessons in Telepractice From the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1044/2022_AJSLP-22-00003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to examine the effect of the COVID-19pandemic on speech-language pathologist (SLP) service provision for emergentbilinguals who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Oneprominent issue in AAC service delivery is the efficacy and feasibility ofproviding AAC services via telepractice. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified thisissue as most providers, clients, and families adjusted to remote servicedelivery models. While emerging evidence supports telepractice in AAC, little is known about the potential benefits and challenges of telepractice for emergentbilinguals who use AAC and their families. METHOD: Data were collected via anationwide survey. Licensed SLPs (N = 160) completed an online questionnaire withLikert-type, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions, analyzed using mixedmethods. RESULTS: Findings illustrated a shift in service delivery from in-personto telepractice and hybrid (both telepractice and in-person) models. Overall,child intervention outcomes declined for emergent bilinguals who used AAC during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of service delivery format. However,collaboration increased for many providers and families. Qualitative analyseshighlighted barriers to AAC service provision for emergent bilinguals who use AACthat were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as factors thatfacilitated collaboration and family engagement. CONCLUSION: These findingssuggest that, despite challenges, telepractice or hybrid services may be apromising approach to provide more culturally responsive, family-centered carefor emergent bilinguals who use AAC.

TI  - "Something for us": Co-development of the COVID-19 Social Site, a web app forlong-term care workers.
LID - 10.2196/38359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving confidence in and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines andboosters among long-term care workers (LTCWs) is a crucial public health goal,given their role in the care of the elderly and people at risk. While difficultto reach with workplace communication interventions, most LTCWs regularly usesocial media and smartphones. Various social media interventions have improvedattitudes and uptake for other vaccines and hold promise for the LTCW population.OBJECTIVE: e aimed to develop a curated social web app (interactive website) toincrease COVID-19 vaccine confidence (three-arm randomized trial underway).METHODS: Following user-centric design and participatory research approaches, we undertook three steps: 1) content identification, 2) platform development, and 3)community building. A LTCW and stakeholder advisory group provided iterativeinput. For content identification, we identified topics of concern about COVID-19vaccines via desktop research (published literature, public opinion polls andsocial media monitoring), refined by interviewing and polling LTCWs. We alsoconducted a national online panel survey. We curated and fact-checked posts from popular social media platforms that addressed the identified concerns. Duringplatform development, we solicited preferences for design and functionality viainterviews and user experience (UX) testing with LTCWs. We also identified bestpractices for online community building, like comment moderation. RESULTS: In theinterviews (n=9), we found three themes: LTCWs 1) are proud of their work butfeel undervalued; 2) have varying levels of trust in COVID-19 relatedinformation, and 3) would welcome a curated COVID-19 resource that is easy tounderstand and use. Desktop research, LTCW interviews and our national onlinepanel survey (n=592) found participants are interested in information aboutCOVID-19 in general, vaccine benefits, vaccine risks, and vaccine development.Content identification resulted in 434 posts addressing these topic areas, with209 uploaded to the final web app. Our LTCW poll (n=8) revealed preferences forpersonal stories and video content. The platform we developed is an accessibleWordPress-based social media web app, refined through formal (n=3) and informalUX testing. Users can sort posts by topic or subtopic and react to or comment on them. To build an online community, we recruited three LTCW 'communityambassadors' and instructed them to encourage discussion, acknowledge concernsand offer factual information on COVID-19 vaccines. We also set 'communitystandards' for the web app. CONCLUSIONS: An iterative, user-centric,participatory approach led to the launch of an accessible social media web appwith curated content for COVID-19 vaccines targeting LTCWs in the U.S. Throughour trial, we will determine if this approach successfully improves vaccineconfidence. If so, a similar social media resource could be used to developcurated social media interventions in other populations and with other publichealth goals. CLINICALTRIAL: This effort is part of a broader clinical trial;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05168800.

AB  - The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, such as the Omicron variants which arehighly transmissible and immune evasive, underscores the need to developtherapeutic antibodies with broad neutralizing activities. Here, we used theLIBRA-seq technology, which identified SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells viaDNA-barcoding and subsequently single cell sequenced BCRs, to identify anantibody, SW186, which could neutralize major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,including Beta, Delta, and Omicron, as well as SARS-CoV-1. The cryo-EM structure of SW186 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike proteinshowed that SW186 interacted with an epitope of the RBD that is not at theinterface of its binding to the ACE2 receptor but highly conserved among SARScoronaviruses. This epitope encompasses a glycosylation site (N343) of the viral spike protein. Administration of SW186 in mice after they were infected withSARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, or Delta variants reduced the viral loads in the lung.These results demonstrated that SW186 neutralizes diverse SARS coronaviruses bybinding to a conserved RBD epitope, which could serve as a target for furtherantibody development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Burnout is associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19. Fewstudies have examined burnout prevalence related to healthcare workers during thepandemic. This study investigated the burnout prevalence and contributing factorsamong HCWs, including medical staff and support staff, during the COVID-19pandemic in an urban community in Thailand. METHODS: A cross-sectional onlinesurvey was distributed among HCWs in Bangkok, Thailand, from July-August 2021.The independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used tocompare the contributing factors and burnout items. Variable factors associatedwith burnout among HCWs were used in multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: A total of 517 HCWs' survey responses were received. Most participants weremedical staff (55.3%), female (83.4%), and over the age of 35 (59.4%); mostparticipants (65.6%) did not have any diseases but had family members that did(63.6%). The prevalence of overall burnout presented among medical staff (25.9%).The results of the multiple linear regression models found that female (vs. male,beta 0.088; 95% CI 0.033, 6.614) was higher associated with overall burnoutscore. In addition, hours of sleep as > 6 hr./day (vs. </= 6 hr./day, beta-0.120; 95% CI -6.012, -0.969) was lower associated with overall burnout score.CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of addressing burnout amongHCWs, in which female medical staff who slept less than six hours per day wereassociated with burnout. Our study further suggested that both intervention andidentification are needed of frontline HCWs to prevent and reduce the risk ofburnout, as the proportion of females compared to males is high. Thus, thegovernment should provide support in these areas to prevent a humanitariancrisis.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270843 [doi]
AB  - This article tries to explore consumer attitudes regarding a balanced diet anddaily calorie intake monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It hasbecome vital to boost people's immunity because of reoccurring diseases such asCOVID-19, Ebola, and other chronic diseases such as diabetes, thyroid disease,etc. Healthy diets are important for supporting immune systems and keeping track of daily calorie consumption is an accompaniment to this. The research onattitudes toward a balanced diet is reviewed in this empirical study. Researchersemployed a tri-component attitude model to assess consumer attitudes about abalanced diet and to track daily calorie consumption. A sample of 400 respondentswas surveyed and data were collected with a structured questionnaire. The datawere analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The majority of respondents were found to lack declarative knowledge of both a balanced diet and daily calorie consumption. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumerattitudes about a healthy diet and daily calorie intake were effectivelyevaluated using beliefs, affection, and intentions. The repercussions for thegovernment and business community were discussed. This study also evaluates theusefulness of the tri-component attitude model in the Indian context.

TI  - A tele-health primary care rehabilitation program improves self-perceivedexertion in COVID-19 survivors experiencing Post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea: Aquasi-experimental study.
PG  - e0271802
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271802 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that up to 70% of COVID-19 survivorsdevelop post-COVID symptoms during the following months after infection. Fatigue and dyspnea seem to be the most prevalent post-COVID symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Toanalyze whether a tele-rehabilitation exercise program is able to improveself-perceived physical exertion in patients with post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea.METHODS: Sixty-eight COVID-19 survivors exhibiting post-COVID fatigue and dyspneaderived to four Primary Health Care centers located in Madrid were enrolled inthis quasi-experimental study. A tele-rehabilitation program based on patienteducation, physical activity, airway clearing, and breathing exerciseinterventions was structured on eighteen sessions (3 sessions/week).Self-perceived physical exertion during daily living activities, dyspneaseverity, health-related quality of life and distance walked and changes inoxygen saturation and heart rate during the 6-Minute walking test were assessedat baseline, after the program and at 1- and 3-months follow-up periods. RESULTS:Daily living activities, dyspnea severity and quality of life improvedsignificantly at all follow-ups (p<0.001). Additionally, a significant increasein oxygen saturation before and after the 6-Minute Walking test was found whencompared with baseline (P<0.001). Heart rate adaptations at rest were foundduring the follow-up periods (P = 0.012). Lower perceived exertion before andafter the 6-Minute Walking test were also observed, even if larger distance were walked (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Tele-rehabilitation programs could be an effective strategy to reduce post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea in COVID-19 survivors. Inaddition, it could also reduce the economic burden of acute COVID-19, reaching a greater number of patients and releasing Intensive Unit Care beds for prioritizedpatients with a severe disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate racial and ethnic differences in mortality among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after adjusting forbaseline characteristics and comorbidities. METHODS: This retrospective cohortstudy at 13 acute care facilities in the New York City metropolitan area includedsequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020.Last day of follow up was July 31, 2020. Patient demographic information,including race/ethnicity and comorbidities, were collected. The primary outcomewas in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 10 869 patients were included inthe study (median age, 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) 54-77; range, 18-107years]; 40.5% female). In adjusted time-to-event analysis, increased age, malesex, insurance type (Medicare and Self-Pay), unknown smoking status, and a higherscore on the Charlson Comorbidity Index were significantly associated with higherin-hospital mortality. Adjusted risk of hospital mortality for Black, Asian,Hispanic, multiracial/other, and unknown race/ethnicity patients were similar to risk for White patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a large diverse cohort of patientshospitalized with COVID-19, patients from racial/ethnic minorities experiencedsimilar mortality risk as White patients.

TI  - Assessing the influence of French vaccine critics during the two first years ofthe COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - e0271157
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271157 [doi]
AB  - When the threat of COVID-19 became widely acknowledged, many hoped that thispandemic would squash "the anti-vaccine movement". However, when vaccines startedarriving in rich countries at the end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine hesitancymight be an issue even in the context of this major pandemic. Does it mean thatthe mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one of the maincauses of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this paper, we wish tocontribute to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic bylooking at one of the many mechanisms which can cause reticence towards vaccines:the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to influence a wider public on social media. We analyze the evolution of debates over the COVID-19 vaccine on theFrench Twittosphere, during two first years of the pandemic, with a particularattention to the spreading capacity of vaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did vaccine-critical contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the main actors in the diffusion of these contents? While debatesover vaccines experienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share ofvaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limitednumber of short periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing the community structure of the re-tweets hyper-graph, we reconstruct the mesoscalestructure of the information flows, identifying and characterizing the majorcommunities of users. We analyze their role in the information ecosystem: thelargest right-wing community has a typical echo-chamber behavior collecting allthe vaccine-critical tweets from outside and recirculating it inside thecommunity. The smaller left-wing community is less permeable to vaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once adopted.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272537 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is found to be one of the external stimuli that greatlyaffects mobility of people, leading to a shift of transportation modes towardsprivate individual ones. To properly explain the change in people's transportbehavior, especially in pre- and post- pandemic periods, a tensor-based frameworkis herein proposed and applied to Pun Pun-the only public bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand-where multidimensional trip data of Pun Pun are decomposedinto four different modes related to their spatial and temporal dimensions by anon-negative Tucker decomposition approach. According to our computationalresults, the first pandemic wave has a sizable influence not only on Pun Pun but also on other modes of transportation. Nonetheless, Pun Pun is relatively moreresilient, as it recovers more quickly than other public transportation modes. Interms of trip patterns, we find that, prior to the pandemic, trips made duringweekdays are dominated by business trips with two peak periods (morning andevening peaks), while those made during weekends are more related to leisureactivities as they involve stations nearby a public park. However, after thefirst pandemic wave ends, the patterns of weekday trips have been drasticallychanged, as the number of business trips sharply drops, while that of educationaltrips connecting metro/subway stations with a major educational institute in the region significantly rises. These findings may be regarded as a reflection of theever-changing transport behavior of people seeking a sustainable mode of private transport, with a more positive outlook on the use of bicycle-sharing system inBangkok, Thailand.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are no clear data about the incidence and the prophylacticstrategies of arterial and venous thromboembolic events (TE) in COVID-19ambulatory patients. Thus, we conducted this study to analyze thromboemboliccomplications in this setting and to assess thromboprophylaxis management andoutcomes in the real life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an observational studyincluding Covid-19 ambulatory patients. We assessed incidence of venous andarterial TE events as well as thromboprophylaxis outcomes and hemorrhagiccomplications. We defined high risk thrombo-embolic factor according to theBelgian guidelines which are the only guidelines that describedthromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 ambulatory patients. RESULTS: We included 2089patients with a mean age of 43+/-16 years. The incidence of 30 days venous andarterial TE complications in our cohort was 1%. Venous thromboemboliccomplications occurred in 0.8% and arterial thromboembolic complications occurredin 0.3%.We noted at least one high-risk TE factor in 18.5% of patients butthromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 22.5% of the cases, LMWH in 18.1%, andRivaroxaban in 3.7%. Hemorrhagic events occurred in eight patients (0.3%): fivepatients showed minor hemorrhagic events and three patients showed major ones(0.14%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications is very low in COVID-19 ambulatory patients. Paradoxically, thereis an over prescription of thrombo-prophylaxis in this population.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is alarmingly a global health catastrophe that has created an unprecedented mental health decline especially in young adults, who have been noted to be a vulnerable population. In this study, we investigated theprevalence of depression and anxiety in university students in China and Africaduring the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant factors contributing to theprevalence of anxiety and depression, the differences in factors affecting thedifferent groups being investigated and to emphasize that psychologicalintervention are as important as the physical interventions during and after the pandemic. The study was conducted through online surveys, with 684 participantsusing Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7standardized scales. Comparing all groups combined, of the 636 participants, 361 (56.8%) had depression and 227 (35.7%) had anxiety. Chi squared tests atsignificance level (P<0.05) showed that country of citizenship, religion,parents' educational background, household monthly income and, having familymembers with COVID-19 variables were strongly associated with depression andanxiety. In contrast, age, gender, educational background, and major showed nosignificant association. Comparing the individual groups separately using chisquare (P<0.05), the Chinese students in China group had 35.6% with depressionand 13.1% with anxiety. The variable associated with both depression and anxiety was education major, with depression only was parent's educational background andwith anxiety only was gender. The African students in China group had 70.3% with depression and 45.0% with anxiety. Gender was strongly associated with bothdepression and anxiety, and religion and having family members with COVID-19 withanxiety only. Africans in Africa had 66.0% with depression and 50.5% withanxiety. Educational background was strongly associated with depression. Therewas no statistically significant variable for anxiety. Chi square test showed astatistically significant difference in depression and anxiety levels with theChinese group compared to both African groups, and no significant differencebetween both African groups. Our findings demonstrated that COVID-19 had anegative psychological impact on university students. Therefore, more attentionshould be put on youth's mental health during this pandemic.

PG  - e0269065
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269065 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether anakinra, an interleukin-1receptorinhibitor, could improve outcome in moderate COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial, we enrolled adults with COVID-19 requiring oxygen. We randomly assigned patients to receive intravenous anakinra plus optimizedstandard of care (oSOC) vs. oSOC alone. The primary outcome was treatment successat day 14 defined as patient alive and not requiring mechanical ventilation orextracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Between 27th April and 6th October 2020, we enrolled 71 patients (240 patients planned to been enrolled): 37 wereassigned to the anakinra group and 34 to oSOC group. The study ended prematurely by recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board due to safety concerns.On day 14, the proportion of treatment success was significantly lower in theanakinra group 70% (n = 26) vs. 91% (n = 31) in the oSOC group: riskdifference-21 percentage points (95% CI, -39 to -2), odds ratio 0.23 (95% CI,0.06 to 0.91), p = 0.027. After a 28-day follow-up, 9 patients in the anakinragroup and 3 in the oSOC group had died. Overall survival at day 28 was 75% (95%CI, 62% to 91%) in the anakinra group versus 91% (95% CI, 82% to 100%) (p = 0.06)in the oSOC group. Serious adverse events occurred in 19 (51%) patients in theanakinra group and 18 (53%) in the oSOC group (p = 0.89). CONCLUSION: This trial did not show efficacy of anakinra in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore,contrary to our hypothesis, we found that anakinra was inferior to oSOC inpatients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, there are no studies of COVID-19 cases and deaths in theNavajo Nation, US. The primary objective of this manuscript is to understandwhether counties with a higher proportion of Navajo (Dine) population also hadhigher cases and deaths of COVID-19 and whether these dropped with vaccination.METHOD: We undertook a cross-sectional analysis of county level data from March16, 2020-May 11, 2021. Data were obtained from public repositories and the USCensus for the Navajo Nation, including northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and northwestern New Mexico. The primary outcome measure is the number ofindividuals with confirmed cases or deaths of COVID-19. A secondary outcome wasCOVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The 11 counties in Navajo Nation have a widevariation in the percent Navajo population, the resources available (ICU beds andoccupancy), and COVID-19 outcomes. Overall, there was a substantial increase inthe number of cases from March 16 -July 16, 2020 (the height of the pandemic)with a doubling time of 10.12 days on Navajo Nation. The percent Navajopopulation was a strong predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths per millionpopulation. COVID-19 vaccinations were inversely associated with COVID-19 casesand deaths in these counties. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic on the NavajoNation is a story of resilience. Navajo Nation was one of the hardest hit areasof the United States, with peak cases and deaths due to COVID-19. With anaggressive vaccination effort, these cases and deaths were strikingly curtailed, showing the resilience of the Navajo (Dine) people.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269962 [doi]
AB  - Five endophytic bacterial isolates were studied to identify morphologically andbiochemically, according to established protocols and further confirmed by 16SrDNA Sanger sequencing, as Priestia megaterium, Staphylococcus caprae,Neobacillus drentensis, Micrococcus yunnanensis, and Sphingomonas paucimobiliz,which were then tested for phytohormone, ammonia, and hydrolytic enzymeproduction. Antioxidant compounds total phenolic content (TPC), and totalflavonoid content (TFC) were assessed by using bacterial crude extracts obtained from 24-hour shake-flask culture. Phylogenetic tree analysis of those identified isolates shared sequence similarities with the members of Bacillus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas species, and after GenBank submission, accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences were found to be MW494406, MW494408,MW494401, MW494402, and MZ021340, respectively. In silico analysis was performed to identify their bioactive genes and compounds in the context of bioactivesecondary metabolite production with medicinal value, where nine significantbioactive compounds according to six different types of bioactive secondarymetabolites were identified, and their structures, gene associations, andprotein-protein networks were analyzed by different computational tools andservers, which were reported earlier with their antimicrobial, anti-infective,antioxidant, and anti-cancer capabilities. These compounds were then docked tothe 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of the novel SARS-COV-2. Docking scoreswere then compared with 3CLpro reference inhibitor (lopinavir), and dockedcompounds were further subjected to ADMET and drug-likeness analyses.Ligand-protein interactions showed that two compounds (microansamycin andaureusimine) interacted favorably with coronavirus 3CLpro. Besides, in silicoanalysis, we also performed NMR for metabolite detection whereas threemetabolites (microansamycin, aureusimine, and stenothricin) were confirmed fromthe 1H NMR profiles. As a consequence, the metabolites found from NMR dataaligned with our in-silico analysis that carries a significant outcome of thisresearch. Finally, Endophytic bacteria collected from medicinal plants canprovide new leading bioactive compounds against target proteins of SARS-COV-2,which could be an effective approach to accelerate drug innovation anddevelopment.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can cause some individuals to experience chronic symptoms.Rates and predictors of chronic COVID-19 symptoms are not fully elucidated.OBJECTIVE: To examine occurrence and patterns of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV2infection (PASC) symptomatology and their relationship with demographics, acuteCOVID-19 symptoms and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses. METHODS: Amulti-stage observational study was performed of adults (>/=18 years) from 5 USstates. Participants completed two rounds of electronic surveys (May-July 2020;April-May 2021) and underwent testing to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein IgGantibody testing. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify clusters of chronic COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 390 adults (median [25%ile, 75%ile] age: 42 [31, 54] years) with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies completed the follow-upsurvey; 92 (24.7%) had >/=1 chronic COVID-19 symptom, with 11-month medianduration of persistent symptoms (range: 1-12 months). The most common chronicCOVID-19 symptoms were fatigue (11.3%), change in smell (9.5%) or taste (5.6%),muscle or joint aches (5.4%) and weakness (4.6%). There were significantly higherproportions of >/=1 persistent COVID-19 symptom (31.5% vs. 18.6%; Chi-square, P =0.004), and particularly fatigue (15.8% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.008) and headaches (5.4% vs. 1.0%, P = 0.011) in females compared to males. Chronic COVID-19 symptoms werealso increased in individuals with >/=6 acute COVID-19 symptoms, Latent classanalysis revealed 4 classes of symptoms. Latent class-1 (change of smell andtaste) was associated with lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels; class-2 and 3(multiple chronic symptoms) were associated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and more severe acute COVID-19 infection. LIMITATIONS: Ambulatory cohortwith less severe acute disease. CONCLUSION: Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infectioncommonly experience chronic symptoms, most commonly fatigue, changes in smell or taste and muscle/joint aches. Female sex, severity of acute COVID-19 infection,and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were associated with the highest risk ofhaving chronic COVID-19 symptoms.

AB  - Commemorating the 2021 ASEAN Dengue Day and advocacy for World Dengue Day, theInternational Society for Neglected Tropical Diseases (ISNTD) and Asian DengueVoice and Action (ADVA) Group jointly hosted the ISNTD-ADVA World Dengue DayForum-Cross Sector Synergies in June 2021. The forum aimed to achieveinternational and multisectoral coordination to consolidate global dengue controland prevention efforts, share best practices and resources, and improve globalpreparedness. The forum featured experts around the world who shared theirinsight, research experience, and strategies to tackle the growing threat ofdengue. Over 2,000 healthcare care professionals, researchers, epidemiologists,and policy makers from 59 countries attended the forum, highlighting the urgency for integrated, multisectoral collaboration between health, environment,education, and policy to continue the march against dengue. Sustained vectorcontrol, environmental management, surveillance improved case management,continuous vaccine advocacy and research, capacity building, politicalcommitment, and community engagement are crucial components of dengue control. A coordinated strategy based on science, transparency, timely and crediblecommunication, and understanding of human behavior is needed to overcome vaccine hesitancy, a major health risk further magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Theforum announced a strong call to action to establish World Dengue Day to improve global awareness, share best practices, and prioritize preparedness in the fight against dengue.

TI  - Serum N-glycomic profiling may provide potential signatures for surveillance ofCOVID-19.

AB  - Disease development and progression are often associated with aberrantglycosylation, indicating that changes in biological fluid glycome maypotentially serve as disease signatures. The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19)pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)represents a significant threat to global human health. However, the effect ofSARS-CoV-2 infection on the overall serum N-glycomic profile has been largelyunexplored. Here, we extended our 96-well-plate-based high-throughput,high-sensitivity N-glycan profiling platform further with the aim of elucidating potential COVID-19-associated serum N-glycomic alterations. Use of this platform revealed both similarities and differences between the serum N-glycomicfingerprints of COVID-19 positive and control cohorts. Although there were nospecific glycan peaks exclusively present or absent in COVID-19 positive cohort, this cohort showed significantly higher levels of glycans and variability. On thecontrary, the overall N-glycomic profiles for healthy controls werewell-contained within a narrow range. From the serum glycomic analysis, we wereable to deduce changes in different glycan subclasses sharing certain structural features. Of significance was the hyperbranched and hypersialylated glycans andtheir derived glycan subclass traits. T-distributed stochastic neighbourembedding (tSNE) and hierarchical heatmap clustering analysis were performed toidentify 13 serum glycomic variables that potentially distinguished the COVID-19 positive from healthy controls. Such serum N-glycomic changes described hereinmay indicate or correlate to the changes in serum glycoproteins upon COVID-19infection. Furthermore, mapping the serum N-glycome following SARS-CoV-2infection may help us better understand the disease and enable "Long-COVID"surveillance to capture the full spectrum of persistent symptoms.

TI  - Cardiac megakaryocytes in SARS-CoV-2 positive autopsies.
LID - 10.1111/his.14734 [doi]
AB  - Thromboembolic phenomena are an important complication of infection by severeacute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Increasing focus on management ofthe thrombotic complications of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led tofurther investigation into the role of platelets, and their precursor cell, themegakaryocyte, during disease course. Previously published post-mortemevaluations of patients who succumbed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) havereported the presence of megakaryocytes in the cardiac microvasculature. Ourseries evaluated a cohort of autopsies performed on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in 2020 (n = 36) and pre-pandemic autopsies performed in early 2020 (n = 12) and selected to represent comorbidities common in cases of severe COVID-19 inaddition to infectious and non-infectious pulmonary disease and thromboembolicphenomena. Cases were assessed for the presence of cardiac megakaryocytes andcorrelate with the presence of pulmonary emboli and laboratory plateletparameters and inflammatory markers. Cardiac megakaryocytes were detected in 64% (23/36) of COVID-19 autopsies, and 40% (5/12) pre-pandemic autopsies, withaverages of 1.77 and 0.84 megakaryocytes per cm(2) , respectively. Within theCOVID-19 cohort, autopsies with detected megakaryocytes had significantly higher platelet counts compared with cases throughout; other platelet parameters werenot statistically significant between groups. Although studies have supported arole of platelets and megakaryocytes in the response to viral infections,including SARS-CoV-2, our findings suggest cardiac megakaryocytes may berepresentative of a non-specific inflammatory response and are frequent in, butnot exclusive to, COVID-19 autopsies.

TI  - Interim Recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices forUse of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine in Persons Aged >/=18 years - United States, July 2022.
PG  - 988-992
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7131a2 [doi]
AB  - The NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) COVID-19 vaccine is a recombinant spike (rS) proteinnanoparticle vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant to protect against infection withSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. On July 13, 2022, the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Novavaxvaccine for primary COVID-19 immunization of unvaccinated adults aged >/=18years, administered as 2 doses (5 mug rS and 50 mug Matrix-M adjuvant in eachdose) 3 weeks apart (1). On July 19, 2022, the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of the Novavax vaccine in persons aged >/=18 years for the prevention of COVID-19.* In theper-protocol(dagger) efficacy analysis, vaccine efficacy (VE) against reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19was 89.6% (95% CI = 82.4%-93.8%). The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 wasthe predominant circulating variant during the period of case accrual for VEassessments. Cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in temporalassociation with vaccination, suggesting a possible causal relationship. The ACIPrecommendation for the use of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is interim and will beupdated as additional information becomes available. The adjuvanted, proteinsubunit-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine provides an additional option forunvaccinated adults, increasing flexibility for the public and for vaccineproviders. Vaccination is important for protection against COVID-19.

AB  - Post-COVID-19 (post-COVID) symptoms and conditions* are new, recurring, orongoing health problems that occur 4 or more weeks after infection withSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Previous studies have characterized and estimated the incidence of post-COVID conditions among adults (1,2), but dataamong children and adolescents are limited (3-8). Using a large medical claimsdatabase, CDC assessed nine potential post-COVID signs and symptoms (symptoms)and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among 781,419 U.S. children andadolescents aged 0-17 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (patients withCOVID-19) compared with 2,344,257 U.S. children and adolescents withoutrecognized COVID-19 (patients without COVID-19) during March 1, 2020-January 31, 2022. The analysis identified several symptoms and conditions with elevatedadjusted hazard ratios among patients with COVID-19 (compared with thosewithout). The highest hazard ratios were recorded for acute pulmonary embolism(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99),venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32),and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this studypopulation. Conversely, symptoms and conditions that were most common in thisstudy population had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were patients without to experience respiratory signs andsymptoms, symptoms of mental conditions, muscle disorders, neurologicalconditions, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, and sleepingdisorders. COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligiblechildren and adolescents, are critical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection andsubsequent illness, including post-COVID symptoms and conditions (9).

TI  - Infectious Disease Underreporting Is Predicted by Country-Level Preparedness,Politics, and Pathogen Severity.
LID - 10.1089/hs.2021.0197 [doi]
AB  - Underreporting of infectious diseases is a pervasive challenge in public healththat has emerged as a central issue in characterizing the dynamics of theCOVID-19 pandemic. Infectious diseases are underreported for a range of reasons, including mild or asymptomatic infections, weak public health infrastructure, andgovernment censorship. In this study, we investigated factors associated withcross-country and cross-pathogen variation in reporting. We performed aliterature search to collect estimates of empirical reporting rates, calculatedas the number of cases reported divided by the estimated number of true cases.This literature search yielded a dataset of reporting rates for 32 pathogens,representing 52 countries. We combined epidemiological and social science theory to identify factors specific to pathogens, country health systems, and politicsthat could influence empirical reporting rates. We performed generalized linearregression to test the relationship between the pathogen- and country-specificfactors that we hypothesized could influence reporting rates, and the reportingrate estimates that we collected in our literature search. Pathogen- andcountry-specific factors were predictive of reporting rates. Deadlier pathogensand sexually transmitted diseases were more likely to be reported. Countryepidemic preparedness was positively associated with reporting completeness,while countries with high levels of media bias in favor of incumbent governments were less likely to report infectious disease cases. Underreporting is a complex phenomenon that is driven by factors specific to pathogens, country healthsystems, and politics. In this study, we identified specific and measurablecomponents of these broader factors that influence pathogen- and country-specificreporting rates and used model selection techniques to build a model that canguide efforts to diagnose, characterize, and reduce underreporting. Furthermore, this model can characterize uncertainty and correct for bias in reportedinfectious disease statistics, particularly when outbreak-specific empiricalestimates of underreporting are unavailable. More precise estimates can informcontrol policies and improve the accuracy of infectious disease models.

TI  - Two large-scale global studies on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy over time: Culture, uncertainty avoidance, and vaccine side-effect concerns.
LID - 10.1037/pspa0000320 [doi]
AB  - This article presents one of the largest and broadest investigations intoCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a burning issue that poses a global threat. First, I provide a timely review of the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancyidentified by prior studies. More importantly, I advance a dynamic, culturalpsychological perspective to examine how the cultural dimension of uncertaintyavoidance partly explains national differences in initial vaccine hesitancy. Totrack global vaccine hesitancy over time, I leveraged a daily survey of 979,971individuals in 67 countries/territories (October 2020 to March 2021) and another daily survey of over 11 million individuals in 244 countries/territories(December 2020 to March 2021). To increase sample representativeness, bothsurveys used algorithms to correct for nonresponse bias and coverage bias.Consistent with my theoretical perspective, people in higher (vs. lower)uncertainty avoidance cultures had higher vaccine hesitancy initially (late 2020)as a function of greater vaccine side-effect concerns, but these differencesdecreased over time as COVID-19 vaccine uptake became prevalent. These findingswere robust after controlling for other cultural dimensions, demographics,COVID-19 severity, government response stringency, socioeconomic indicators,common vaccine coverage, and religiosity. Understanding cultural differences invaccine hesitancy is important, as delaying vaccination for even a short periodcan increase morbidity and mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study prospectively assesses the implication of (a) exposure todistant trauma of war captivity, (b) stressful life events across the life span, and (c) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories and current PTSD, onsubstance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: One hundred and twentyIsraeli ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and 65 matched veterans of the 1973 YomKippur War filled out self-report questionnaires in 4 waves of assessment (T1-18,T2-30, T3-35, and T4-42 years after the war). A fifth wave of assessment (T5) wasconducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 47 years after the war. RESULTS:Whereas in the earlier assessments (T1-T4) war captivity was not related tosubstance use, during the COVID-19 pandemic (T5) ex-POWs reported higher increaseof use of alcohol, tranquilizers, cannabis, and sleep medications than comparableveterans. War-induced PTSD trajectories that were prospectively measured between T1-T4, and concurrent PTSD during the pandemic (T5) were related to increase insubstance use during the pandemic (T5). CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate thelong-term effects of both earlier experience of severe traumatic stress in young adulthood and the resultant PTSD trajectories, as reflected in increasedsubstance use among the elderly, in the face of subsequent calamity.

TI  - Burnout following moral injury and dehumanization: A study of distress amongItalian medical staff during the first COVID-19 pandemic period.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Italy was the first country outside Asia to deal with the early phaseof the COVID-19 pandemic, and health care facilities and medical staff were notfully prepared. Research worldwide has documented the enormous effect of theCOVID-19 pandemic on health care providers' mental health, including experiences of dehumanization, but less work has focused on factors which may influence thedevelopment of these outcomes in response to COVID-19-related stress. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association of dehumanization, self-efficacy, andalienation to burnout, depression, and PTSD among medical staff. Potentialmoderators included moral injury, professional role, COVID workload, and work in a critical care unit (CCU). METHOD: Participants were recruited through theInternet. The sample consisted of 270 medical staff members who completed aself-report survey online. Instruments included: Human Traits Attribution Scalefor dehumanization; NYP-Queens Survey-Self-Efficacy Subscale for self-efficacy;Moral Injury Events Scale for moral injury; Alienation Scale for alienation;PTSD-8 for posttraumatic stress disorder; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 fordepression; and a single item for burnout. The analytic plan included ANOVAs,zero-order correlations, logistic regression analyses, multiple linear regressionmodels, and parallel mediation. RESULTS: Results show that dehumanization wasassociated with higher levels of burnout, PTSD, and depressive symptoms andeffects were consistent across professional role and work context. Dehumanizationwas significantly associated with PTSD symptoms only among those who hadincreased COVID-19-related caseloads. Moral injury was positively associated withdehumanization, displayed an independent association with all 3 mental healthoutcomes, over and above dehumanization, and tended to exacerbate the effects of dehumanization. The effect sizes across analyses were small to medium.CONCLUSION: This research confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic stressed Italianmedical staff in a way not documented in the prepandemic literature. There is aneed to support staff in their complex relationships and communication withpatients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Posttraumatic growth as a moderator between pandemic-related distress and mental health symptoms in U.S. young adults.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001306 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compared to other age groups, young adults are at risk of sufferingCOVID-19 pandemic-related psychological problems. Prior research suggests thatsuch adverse events (like the pandemic) can initiate adaptive psychologicalchanges, referred to as posttraumatic growth (PTG); however, limited studies haveexamined the moderating role of PTG among young adults in the United States with regard to COVID-19-related distress. Thus, this study examines whetherpandemic-related distress has a differential effect on young adults' mentalhealth symptoms based on varying levels of PTG. METHOD: Using the data from 661participants who completed all three waves of the CARES study (T(1): April-August2020; T(2): September 2020-March 2021; T(3): April-May 2021), a moderatoranalysis was performed using the PROCESS Macro to determine the moderating effectof PTG. RESULTS: In our data, higher levels of PTG buffered the effects ofpandemic-related distress from 2020 on depressive symptoms in 2021; PTG did notshow a moderating effect with anxiety as an outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Understandingthe moderating role of PTG would help to further understand the mental healthtrajectories of young adults in the United States who are particularly distressedby the pandemic. Our findings suggest the importance of further exploringcontributors to PTG for young adults, particularly among those who haveexperienced high levels of pandemic-related distress to date.

TI  - A model of collaborative immigration advocacy to prevent policy-based trauma and harm.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001330 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research suggests that antiimmigrant policies enacted in the UnitedStates, magnified during the 2016-2020 period, propagate widespread trauma acrosscommunities of immigrants (von Werthern et al., 2018). While these policies harm all groups of immigrants, structural conditions (e.g., lack of documentationstatus, race, ethnicity, country of origin, and other social and legaldeterminants) shape how they are experienced. To address the widespread traumaticharm inflicted by racist and xenophobic policies, a group of leaders from eightDivisions of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National LatinxPsychological Association (NLPA) launched an Interdivisional Immigration Project (IIP). METHOD: The IIP served to develop a model for collaborative advocacy,bringing together mental health providers (i.e., psychologists, social workers), allied professionals, and immigration activists from community organizationsacross the country. This model was developed over the course of 1 year,coinciding with the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and theamplified movement for racial justice. RESULTS: This article describes the keycomponents of the IIP collaborative advocacy model: (a) structuring leadership ina democratic and egalitarian manner, (b) centering and uplifting immigrantvoices, (c) forming teams across five U.S. regions, (d) facilitating criticaldialogues grounded in liberatory practices, (e) centering trauma and empowerment,and (f) developing advocacy strategies. The IIP collaborative advocacy model isinforming advocacy to protect immigrants from harm. DISCUSSION: This model may beused as the basis for ongoing humane immigration policy activism that centers thevoices of community activists, and that pushes psychologists and alliedprofessionals to use their positionality to support community-based efforts.(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Adding fuel to the fire? Examining exposure to potentially stressful or traumaticevents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income, Black families.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001336 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of many individuals. Whileemerging evidence has begun to document health (e.g., infection) and financial(e.g., job loss) consequences, less is known about the day-to-day experiences of some of the country's most vulnerable populations. The current study sought toaddress this gap in understanding by examining exposure to potentially stressful or traumatic experiences (PSTEs) and their relation to mental health amongpredominately low-income, African American/Black individuals. METHOD: Adultcaregivers (N = 110) from an ongoing longitudinal research project occurringprior the pandemic completed surveys about their exposure to COVID-19-specificPSTEs during the initial months of the pandemic. Information on participants was combined with pre-COVID-19 PSTE exposure and examined in relation to currentmental health functioning (e.g., depression). RESULTS: Findings indicated thatparticipants experienced several different types of COVID-19-specific PSTEsacross multiple domains, including home, work, social life, and health andwell-being. Results from model testing indicated that COVID-19-specific PSTEswere only associated with worry about COVID-19-specifically. Adulthood PSTEsprior to COVID-19 were also associated with current anxiety symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Among low-income, African American/Black individuals with a history of exposure to PSTEs, additional PSTEs experienced during the COVID-19 pandemicmay not contribute significantly to general mental health functioning above andbeyond pre-COVID-19 PSTE exposures. Taken together, research on PSTE exposurefrom the pandemic should make attempts to account for lifetime PSTE exposure tomost accurately evaluate current mental health concerns, especially amongmarginalized populations.

TI  - Short-term psychological outcomes of Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001323 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated how Australian community members (N = 318) indirectly and/or directly exposed to Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season differed in terms of psychological distress, posttraumatic growth, coping, physical health, andCOVID-19 anxiety. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study with a nonequivalentgroups design. Participants were over 18 years old, English proficient, andAustralian permanent residents or citizens living in Australia at some pointbetween June 2019 and February 2020. Participants completed a 10-minute anonymousonline survey 5 to 8 weeks following the bushfires. RESULTS: A descriptivediscriminant analysis revealed a statistically significant difference betweenbushfire exposure groups when considering our dependent variables of interestsimultaneously and adjusting for prior mental health assistance and priorexposure to natural disasters: F(10, 624) = 2.83, p = .002; V = .087, partialeta(2) = .043. The group centroid for the indirect-only exposure group (-.374)was substantially lower than that for the other 2 groups (direct only: .137;direct + indirect: .224), indicating that the indirect-only exposure group could be differentiated by the fact that they more frequently reported avoidant coping strategies and endorsed lower posttraumatic growth scores than the direct-onlyand direct + indirect exposure groups. The variance accounted for by thesediscriminant variables was 8.4%, indicating a very small effect. CONCLUSION: Our results point to a need to tailor and/or expand disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts such that they might benefit community members both directlyand indirectly exposed to bushfire events in Australia.

TI  - Distortions in time perception during collective trauma: Insights from a nationallongitudinal study during the COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001326 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During the protracted collective trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, lay of distorted perceptions of time (e.g., time slowing, days blurring together,uncertainty about the future) have been widespread. Known as "temporaldisintegration" in psychiatric literature, these distortions are associated with negative mental health consequences. However, the prevalence and predictors oftemporal disintegration are poorly understood. We examined perceptions of timepassing and their associations with lifetime stress and trauma andpandemic-related secondary stress as COVID-19 spread across the United States.METHOD: A probability-based national sample (N = 5,661) from the NORC AmeriSpeak online panel, which had completed a mental and physical health survey prior tothe pandemic, completed two surveys online during March 18-April 18, 2020, andSeptember 26-October 16, 2020. Distorted time perceptions and otherpandemic-related experiences were assessed. RESULTS: Present focus, blurringweekdays and weekdays together, and uncertainty about the future were commonexperiences reported by over 65% of the sample 6 months into the pandemic. Halfof the sample reported time speeding up or slowing down. Predictors of temporaldisintegration include prepandemic mental health diagnoses, dailypandemic-related media exposure and secondary stress (e.g., school closures,lockdown), financial stress, and lifetime stress and trauma exposure. CONCLUSION:During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, distortions in timeperception were very common and associated with prepandemic mental health,lifetime stress and trauma exposure, and pandemic-related media exposure andstressors. Given that temporal disintegration is a risk factor for mental health challenges, these findings have potential implications for public mental health.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude, Practices, and Vaccine Hesitancy Among the Latinx Community in Southern California Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey.
PG  - e38351
LID - 10.2196/38351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Latinx population in the United States has experienced high ratesof infection, hospitalization, and death since the beginning of the COVID-19pandemic. There is little data on the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP)specifically in Latinx communities in the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed toassess COVID-19 KAP and vaccine hesitancy among a Latinx cohort in the earlystages of the COVID-19 pandemic (from July 2020 to October 2020), at a uniquetime when a vaccine was not available. METHODS: Participants aged >/=18 yearswere recruited at a primary care clinic in Southern California and asked toself-report sociodemographic characteristics, KAP, and vaccine hesitancy. Asubset of the participants answered the vaccine hesitancy assessment as it wasadded after the start of data collection. KAP items were summed to createcomposite scores, with higher scores reflecting increased COVID-19 knowledge,positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, and disease preventionpractices. Bivariate and multivariable regression models were fitted to testassociations between sociodemographic characteristics and KAP scores. For ouranalysis, we only included patients who self-identified as Latinx. RESULTS: Ourfinal data set included 265 participants. The participants had a mean age of 49(IQR 38.5-59) years, and 72.1% (n=191) were female, 77% (n=204) had at most ahigh school degree, 34.7% (n=92) had an annual income <US $25,000, and 11.7%(n=31) had previously tested positive for COVID-19. We found high knowledgeregarding transmission and spread; moderate knowledge regarding symptomsawareness; overall negative attitudes, which included high pessimism ingovernment public health efforts and high amounts of fear, anxiety, andfrustration due to COVID-19 pandemic; and moderate participation in preventivepractices. A college education was positively associated with a higher knowledge score than those without a college education (beta=0.14, 95% CI 0.01-1.60; P=.04)when adjusted for covariates. Male gender had a positive association withCOVID-19 attitude scores compared to female gender (beta=1.61, 95% CI 0.50-2.72; P=.05), and male gender was negatively associated with the COVID-19 practicesscore compared to female gender (beta=-0.16, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.06; P=.03), when both were adjusted for covariates. Among a subset of 203 patients, 26.6% (n=54)indicated that if the vaccine was available, they would not take a COVID-19vaccine, and 18.7% (n=38) were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge andpreventative practices in the population may have reflected effective publichealth messaging and the implementation of public health laws during the firstwave of the pandemic; however, the overall fear and anxiety may have reflectedthe negative impact that the pandemic had on vulnerable populations such as theLatinx community. Although our data are a reflection of a previous time in thepandemic, we believe it captures a critical time that can be used to provideunique insights regarding potential avenues to better protect the Latinxcommunities against future vaccine-resistant COVID-19 strains.

AB  - Our study demonstrates that neither 2020-convalescent plasma (CP) nor2019/2020-immunoglobulin (IVIG) neutralize Omicron subvariants BA.1 to BA.5. Incontrast, hyperimmune 2020-hCoV-2IG lots neutralized Omicron VOCs, similar to2022-CP from BA.1 breakthrough infections. Therefore, high-titer hCoV-2IG and CP could be evaluated for treatment of high-risk individuals infected withcirculating Omicron subvariants.

TI  - Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from adult index cases living with andwithout HIV in South Africa, 2020-2021: a case-ascertained, prospectiveobservational household transmission study.
LID - ciac640 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac640 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In South Africa, 19% of the adult population are living with HIV(LWH). Few data on the influence of HIV on SARS-CoV-2 household transmission are available. METHODS: We performed a case-ascertained, prospective householdtransmission study of symptomatic index SARS-CoV-2 cases LWH and HIV-uninfectedadults and their contacts in South Africa, October 2020 to September 2021.Households were followed up thrice weekly for 6 weeks to collect nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing. We estimated household cumulative infection risk (HCIR) andduration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (at cycle threshold value <30 as proxy for highviral load). RESULTS: We recruited 131 index cases and 457 household contacts.HCIR was 59% (220/373); not differing by index HIV status (60% [51/85] in casesLWH vs 58% [163/279] in HIV-uninfected cases, OR 1.0, 95%CI 0.4-2.3). HCIRincreased with index case age (35-59 years: aOR 3.4 95%CI 1.5-7.8 and >/=60years: aOR 3.1, 95%CI 1.0-10.1) compared to 18-34 years, and contacts' age, 13-17years (aOR 7.1, 95%CI 1.5-33.9) and 18-34 years (aOR 4.4, 95%CI 1.0-18.4)compared to <5 years. Mean positivity duration at high viral load was 7 days(range 2-17), with longer positivity in cases LWH (aHR 0.4, 95%CI 0.1-0.9).CONCLUSIONS: Index HIV status was not associated with higher HCIR, but cases LWH had longer positivity duration at high viral load. Adults aged >35 years weremore likely to transmit, individuals aged 13-34 to acquire SARS-CoV-2 in thehousehold. As HIV infection may increase transmission, health services mustmaintain HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy initiation.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused bysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The gold standardmethod for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 depends on quantitative reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction till now, which is time-consuming andrequires expensive instrumentation, and the confirmation of variants relies onfurther sequencing techniques. Herein, we first proposed a robusttechnique-methodology of electrochemical CRISPR sensing with the advantages ofrapid, highly sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2variant. To enhance the sensing capability, gold electrodes are uniformlydecorated with electro-deposited gold nanoparticles. Using DNA template identicalto SARS-CoV-2 Delta spike gene sequence as model, our biosensor exhibitsexcellent analytical detection limit (50 fM) and high linearity (R(2) = 0.987)over six orders of magnitude dynamic range from 100 fM to 10 nM without anynucleic-acid-amplification assays. The detection can be completed within 1 h withhigh stability and specificity which benefits from the CRISPR-Cas system.Furthermore, based on the wireless micro-electrochemical platform, the proposedbiosensor reveals promising application ability in point-of-care testing.

AB  - The goal of the study here is to analyze and assess whether strict containmentpolicies to cope with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis areeffective interventions to reduce high numbers of infections and deaths. Ahomogenous sample of 31 countries is categorized in two sets: countries with highor low strictness of public policy to cope with COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Thefindings here suggest that countries with a low intensity of strictness haveaverage confirmed cases and fatality rates related to COVID-19 lower thancountries with high strictness in containment policies (confirmed cases are24.69% vs. 26.06% and fatality rates are 74.33% vs. 76.38%, respectively, incountries with low and high strictness of COVID-19 public policies ofcontainment). What this study adds is that high levels of strict restrictionpolicies may not be useful measures of control in containing the spread andnegative impact of pandemics similar to COVID-19 and additionally a highstrictness in containment policies generates substantial social and economiccosts. These findings can be explained with manifold socioeconomic andenvironmental factors that support transmission dynamics and circulation ofCOVID-19 pandemic. Hence, high levels of strictness in public policy (and also a high share of administering new vaccines) seem to have low effectiveness to stop pandemics similar to COVID-19 driven by mutant viral agents. These results heresuggest that the design of effective health policies for prevention andpreparedness of future pandemics should be underpinned in a good governance ofcountries and adoption of new technology, rather than strict and generalizedhealth polices having ambiguous effects of containment in society.

LID - 10.1007/s10900-022-01076-6 [doi]
AB  - Due to the sudden rise in the cases of COVID-19 in the North-Eastern region ofIndia, this study was conducted to survey the felt needs of the medicalprofessionals with regards to education on the evidence-based management ofCOVID-19. A total of 25 North-East leaders were recruited and a baseline surveywas conducted through the digital medium. Out of 25 North-East leaders, 52% were undergoing training in evidence-based medicine in the capacity-building programfor evidence-based child health. Participants (48%) strongly agreed and 40%agreed on the possibility of enhanced care by capacity building in the areas ofCOVID-19 management through discussing cases. Out of 25 North East leaders, 48%agreed to join both as a speaker as well as a participant. Various prioritytopics on COVID-19 management e.g. childhood, adult, ocular manifestation, ICUmanagement, telemedicine, vaccines, lab protocols, psychological distress, andtreatment strategy have emerged. We have presented the findings of the surveywhich will help guide the mentoring program focusing on evidence-based managementof COVID-19 in remote areas through Tele-education.

TI  - Long-term use of burosumab for the treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia.
LID - 10.1007/s00198-022-06516-6 [doi]
AB  - Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome caused bytumoral overproduction of FGF-23. Due to local recurrence, we describe thelong-term efficacy and safety profile of burosumab, an anti-FGF-23 monoclonalantibody, in a TIO patient after three unsuccessfully surgical attempts.INTRODUCTION: TIO is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome caused by tumoraloverproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), resulting inhyperphospaturia, hypophosphatemia, and osteomalacia. Surgery is the onlydefinitive treatment, but tumor can locally recur, even after years from primary surgery. Furthermore, some tumors cannot be removed by surgery due to theirlocation. METHODS: We describe the case of a 54-year-old woman affected byrecurrent TIO who, after three unsuccessful surgical attempts of tumor removal,was treated with burosumab, an anti-FGF-23 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Thepatient was referred to our Bone Unit after experiencing several fractures indifferent sites, both traumatic and non-traumatic. At the time of firstevaluation, at the age of 46, serum-phosphate (SP) was 1.2 mg/dL (reference range(RR) 2.5-4.5), 24-h urinary phosphate was 842 mg (RR 400-1000), and intact-FGF-23was 117 pg/mL (RR 25-45). Imaging showed a metabolic pre-sacral lesion thatfirstly underwent to exploratory laparotomy. Then, patient underwent to surgical excision of tumor. After 18 months of well-being, tumor relapsed and even thesubsequent surgery was not able to completely remove it. Since 2015, patient was maintained in phosphorus supplements and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D3, but SP levels nevernormalized. In September 2019, she was started on burosumab, initially at thedose of 0.3 mg/kg/month, progressively increased to the current 0.8 mg/kg/month, with great improvement of pain, physical performance, and normalization of SPlevels. Burosumab was temporary and cautionary discontinued for COVID-19pneumonia, with a worsening of SP. After restart of burosumab, biochemistryreturned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first Europeanpatient affected by TIO treated with burosumab for more than 2 years. Burosumabis a promising therapy in the medical treatment of TIO refractory or not eligiblefor definitive surgery, with good efficacy and safety profile.

TI  - [Testing of practical surgical teaching at a distance-Experiences with a hybridOSCE in surgery].
LID - 10.1007/s00104-022-01650-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed medical teaching worldwide. Digitalteaching and examinations are successful for cognitive learning objectives,whereas practical skills had to be carried out predominantly in person understrict hygiene standards. AIM: This study presents the opportunities andchallenges of using a presence objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)at a distance with digital support. METHOD: Following surgical practical teachingan OSCE was conducted in presence, where students demonstrated practical skillsin one room while the examiners were connected via videoconference from anotherroom. Students were surveyed about the OSCE and sustained learning via astandardized online questionnaire after completion of the surgical teaching.Additionally, examiners were surveyed on their experiences. RESULTS: In theonline survey 40 students participated (25% of n= 157 students contacted) and 36 completed questionnaires were analyzed. Overall, the implementation of an OSCEeven under pandemic conditions was perceived as very positive by the students(92% of students n= 33). In particular, the acquisition of practical skills wasrated as very high. For 78% (n= 28) of the students, the acquisition ofcompetencies through the practical examination was particularly sustainable. The vast majority of students and examiners felt safe regarding infection controlbecause of the hygiene concept (92%, n= 33). Overall, 80 students achieved grade 1 (51%), 71 students grade 2 (45.2%) and 6 students grade 3 (3.8%) (grade 1= verygood, grade 6= very bad). CONCLUSION: Practical examinations are essential forchecking practical learning objectives and can be implemented at a distance with a well-developed hygiene concept and digital support.

LID - 10.1007/s00108-022-01369-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sizable part of post-COVID syndrome meets the diagnostic criteriafor myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A doubling ofcases of ME/CFS within the next years is therefore projected. OBJECTIVES:Presentation of the current state of knowledge on ME/CFS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unsystematic review of the literature and of own contributions in research andpatient care. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: ME/CFS is a neuroimmunological disease,mostly infection-induced, usually persisting throughout life. Clinically it ischaracterized by fatigue lasting at least 6 months and the defining core feature of exercise intolerance (post-exertional malaise, PEM). Exercise intolerance isdefined as a worsening of symptoms after (even mild) everyday exertion, whichusually begins after several hours or on the following day, is still noticeableat least 14 h after exertion, and often lasts for several days (up to weeks orlonger). Furthermore, ME/CFS is characterized by pain, disturbances of sleep,thinking and memory, and dysregulation of the circulatory, endocrine, and immune systems. As a separate clinical entity, ME/CFS should be distinguished fromchronic fatigue, which occurs as a symptom of a range of very different diseases.The diagnosis of ME/CFS is made clinically using established internationaldiagnostic criteria and requires careful stepwise diagnosis to exclude otherdiagnoses. A causal therapy for ME/CFS has not been established; the focus is on symptoms relief, treatment of the often accompanying orthostatic intolerance, andassistance with anticipatory energy management (pacing).

PG  - 819-829
LID - 10.1007/s00108-022-01371-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary manifestations are very common sequelae after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, which aresummarized under the term long COVID (coronavirus disease) syndrome. AIM/METHODS:This article summarizes the current literature on pulmonary manifestations with afocus on expert opinions and recommendations. RESULTS: After chronic fatigue,dyspnea is the most common symptom in patients with long COVID syndrome.Pathological findings are mainly found after a severe acute course of COVID-19and include radiological changes with characteristics of interstitial lungdiseases, restrictive ventilation patterns and limitations in diffusion capacity as the most common pathological finding. Although both symptoms and pathological pulmonary alterations improve over time, some patients may still suffer fromabnormalities months after the acute infection. The relevance of the pathologicalfindings, as well as the involvement of functional respiratory limitations,cardiopulmonary deconditioning, non-somatic causes and pre-existing lungdiseases, is currently unclear. The advanced diagnostic assessment thus focusses on high-risk patients and includes, in addition to imaging and pulmonary functiontests, a cardiopulmonary exercise test and, if the findings are unclear, anechocardiography to diagnose a pulmonary vascular component. The therapeuticoptions currently include treatment of the underlying causes of the symptoms(e.g. interstitial lung diseases, cough) according to the respective guidelinesand rehabilitation measures. DISCUSSION: The current knowledge about pulmonarymanifestations in long COVID patients is constantly being expanded, but due tolimited availability of clinical trials, there are still no evidence-basedguidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary manifestations in longCOVID syndrome.

AB  - There are currently no strategies available on how to deal with Long-COVID (COVID"coronavirus disease"). COVID-19 vaccination could be both a preemptive and atherapeutic option for the future. The evaluation of the available studies iscomplicated by varying definitions. There are, however, indications that(complete) COVID-19 vaccination is able not only to prevent symptomatic infectionbut also to reduce the risk of Long-COVID. In some patients with Long-COVID,symptoms are modified after (first and/or second) COVID-19 vaccination; however, there is no clear evidence for a real therapeutic effect on Long-COVID.

AB  - Between 10 and 20% of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suffer from symptoms up to weeks after initialinfection. The most frequently reported symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea,anosmia and ageusia, as well as headaches, joint pain, cough, cognitiveimpairment and impaired sleeping. After exclusion of other etiologies and symptomduration of more than 4 weeks after initial infection this is referred to as longCOVID. In contrast to acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific riskfactors have been identified as yet as being associated with the occurrence ofthis disease. Furthermore, there are varying hypotheses concerning thepathomechanism of long COVID. Dividing patients into groups is beneficial in the clinical context. Regardless of long COVID symptoms the risk of cardiovascularevents is increased even 1 year after COVID-19.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on digital practice in UK paediatric speech and languagetherapy and implications for the future: A national survey.
LID - 10.1111/1460-6984.12750 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures to reduce transmission risk has led to unprecedented digital transformation across health, education andsocial care services. This includes UK paediatric speech and language therapy(SLT), which sits at the crossroads of these services. Given the rapid onset ofthis pandemic-induced digital transition, there is now a need to capture, reflectand learn from the SLT profession so that benefits can be sustained, and barriersaddressed. AIMS: To survey the impact of COVID-19 remote working on UK paediatricSLTs' digital views and experiences using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivationand Behaviour (COM-B) model. METHODS & PROCEDURES: An online survey was conductedfrom May to October 2020. Respondents were asked to rate their use of technology in service delivery before and during the pandemic, to select factorsfacilitating digital practice, and to provide open-response aspirations for thefuture role of technology in paediatric SLT which were analysed thematicallyusing the COM-B behaviour change model. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: A total of 424 UKpaediatric SLTs responded to the survey. Findings indicate a marked increase inclinicians' perception of their frequency, convenience and confidence withdigital practice during COVID-19 compared with before the pandemic. Respondentsidentified that specialist training (27%), funding for workplace devices (22%)and supportive leadership (19%) were most likely to facilitate sustained digital practice. Clinicians hoped for a blended approach going forward with technologyenhancing existing best practice. Further prominent themes included digitalaccessibility for all and maintaining the increased opportunity formultidisciplinary working that videoconferencing has afforded. Moreservice-specific aspirations were bespoke technological solutions as well asparents/carers being able to engage remotely with school-based provisions.CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: During COVID-19, paediatric SLTs' recognition andacceptance of how technology can augment practice has accelerated, withparticular value being placed on inclusivity, choice, training, resources,leadership and indication of effectiveness. These are important considerations tohelp guide the profession towards the long-term digital enhancement of SLTservices. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject The COVID-19pandemic led to an unprecedented interest in the use of technology across SLTpractice. Studies are emerging nationally and internationally to identify thedigital priorities of the SLT workforce, the areas of digital SLT provision that are thriving or lacking, and the evidence to guide clinical practice and service development. What this study adds to existing knowledge This is the first UK-wideCOVID-19 survey solely focusing on the digital practice of paediatric SLTs. Thefindings provide critical insights into SLT perception of how practice has beenimpacted in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including digital trendsthat are service, condition and demographic specific. Tools and channels requiredto support sustained beneficial change are also discussed. What are the potentialor actual clinical implications of this work? This paper demonstrates thepotential for digital solutions to enhance SLT practice, as long asimplementation is guided by clinicians' experiences and perspectives. Thefindings lay groundwork for service development work, such as the creation oftraining packages, updating of clinical guidelines and care pathways, anddevelopment of processes to ensure equitable allocation of evidence-basedresources.

PG  - 708-713
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The WHO-5 is a brief measure of psychological well-being. Validitystudies for the WHO-5 are quite limited in sub-Saharan Africa and mostimportantly, no study has confirmed the unidimensional factor structure of theinstrument in Nigeria. The aim of this research is to evaluate the reliabilityand determine the unidimensional factor structure of the WHO-5 well-being indexin a population of medical doctors and nurses in Nigeria during the COVID-19pandemic. METHODS: Overall, 464 medical doctors and nurses from various parts of Nigeria, completed the assessment between April and July 2020. The participantscompleted the WHO-5 well-being index and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out. The internalconsistency of the WHO-5 was measured and external validity was determined aswell. RESULTS: The inter-item correlations among the WHO-5 items ranged from0.447 to 0.685. Internal consistency was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.868). Thecorrected item-total correlations ranged from 0.596 to 0.750 with a mean of0.693. PCA identified a single factor structure of the WHO-5. The WHO-5significantly correlated with the PHQ-9 (r = -0.590), ascertaining convergentvalidity. CONCLUSION: The WHO-5 demonstrated satisfactory reliability andvalidity in our study population. It is therefore a suitable measure for theassessment of the mental well-being of healthcare professionals in ourenvironment.

AB  - This article has three aims. First, to reflect on how conceptualizations of thepublic interest may have shifted due to COVID-19. Second, to focus on theimplications of regulatory responses for the health workforce and correspondinglessons as health leaders and systems transition from pandemic response topandemic recovery. Third, to identify how these lessons lead to potentialdirections for future research, connecting regulation in a whole-of-systemsapproach to health system safety and health workforce capacity andsustainability. Pandemic regulatory responses highlighted both strengths andlimitations of regulatory structures and frameworks. The COVID-19 pandemic mayhave introduced new considerations around regulating in the public interest,particularly as the impact of regulatory responses on the health workforcecontinues to be examined. Clearly articulating practitioner practice parameters, reducing barriers to practice, and working collaboratively with stakeholders wereprimary aspects of regulators' pandemic responses that impacted the healthworkforce.

PG  - 703-707
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has ravaged the world with significantimplications on the socio-economic and health status of individuals. Severalmeasures were put in place to curtail the pandemic especially movementrestrictions. The effect of this pandemic and the restriction measures couldfurther compound the health needs of PLWHA. This study thus described the trendin access to HIV/AIDS care services before and during the COVID-19 inducedlockdown and the possible consequences on their treatment outcome. METHODS: Asecondary analysis of client data was carried out at the HIV clinic of theNigerian Institute of Medical Research. The sociodemographic and clinical data[type of ART, duration on ART, clinical services 3-months before and during theCOVID-19 induced Lockdown] were extracted from the electronic medical records.Data obtained was analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0. RESULTS: The median ageof PLWHA was 45 years (IQR: 39-51), with the predominant age group being 25-49years (65.4%). The majority were females (68.7%), married (59.5%), had at leastsecondary education (82.8%), and employed (81.5%). The median duration on ART was102 months (IQR: 67-138) with the majority on non-Protease Inhibitor basedregimen (77.7%). In the 3 months before the lockdown, there was an increase indrug pick-up of approximately 25% over the booked appointment compared to adecline of 40% when the lockdown was enacted. CONCLUSION: The significant declinein drug pick-up during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic raises the need for measures toensure continued access to drugs and care among PLWHA.

TI  - Human Adenovirus Type 26 Infection Mediated by alphavbeta3 Integrin IsCaveolin-1-Dependent.
PG  - e0109722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01097-22 [doi]
AB  - Human adenovirus type 26 (HAdV26) has been recognized as a promising platform forvaccine vector development, and very recently vaccine against COVID-19 based onHAdV26 was authorized for emergency use. Nevertheless, basic biology of thisvirus, namely, pathway which HAdV26 uses to enter the cell, is stillinsufficiently known. We have shown here that HAdV26 infection of humanepithelial cells expressing low amount of alphavbeta3 integrin involves clathrin and is caveolin-1-independent, while HAdV26 infection of cells with high amountof alphavbeta3 integrin does not involve clathrin but is caveolin-1-dependent.Thus, this study demonstrates that caveolin-1 is limiting factor in alphavbeta3integrin-mediated HAdV26 infection. Regardless of alphavbeta3 integrinexpression, HAdV26 infection involves dynamin-2. Our data provide for thefirst-time description of HAdV26 cell entry pathway, hence increase our knowledgeof HAdV26 infection. Knowing that functionality of adenovirus vector isinfluenced by its cell entry pathway and intracellular trafficking, our resultswill contribute to better understanding of HAdV26 immunogenicity and antigenpresentation when used as vaccine vector. IMPORTANCE In order to fulfill its roleas a vector, adenovirus needs to successfully deliver its DNA genome to the host nucleus, a process highly influenced by adenovirus intracellular translocation.Thus, cell entry pathway and intracellular trafficking determine functionality ofhuman adenovirus-based vectors. Endocytosis of HAdV26, currently extensivelystudied as a vaccine vector, has not been described so far. We present here that HAdV26 infection of human epithelial cells with high expression of alphavbeta3integrin, one of the putative HAdV26 receptors, is caveolin-1- and partiallydynamin-2-dependent. Since caveolin containing domains provide a uniqueenvironment for specific signaling events and participate in inflammatorysignaling one can imagine that directing HAdV26 cell entry towardcaveolin-1-mediate pathway might play role in immunogenicity of this virus.Therefore, our results contribute to better understanding of HAdV26 infectionpathway, hence, can be helpful in explaining induction of immune response andantigen presentation by HAdV26-based vaccine vector.

TI  - A SCID Mouse Model To Evaluate the Efficacy of Antivirals against SARS-CoV-2Infection.
PG  - e0075822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00758-22 [doi]
AB  - Ancestral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lacks the intrinsic ability to bind to the mouse ACE2 receptor, and therefore establishmentof SARS-CoV-2 mouse models has been limited to the use of mouse-adapted virusesor genetically modified mice. Interestingly, some of the variants of concern,such as the Beta B.1.351 variant, show an improved binding to the mouse receptor and hence better replication in different wild-type (WT) mouse species. Here, we describe the establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 Beta B.1.351 variant infection modelin male SCID mice as a tool to assess the antiviral efficacy of potentialSARS-CoV-2 small-molecule inhibitors. Intranasal infection of male SCID mice with10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the Beta B.1.351 variantresulted in high viral loads in the lungs and moderate signs of lung pathology onday 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with the antiviral drugsmolnupiravir (200 mg/kg, twice a day [BID]) or nirmatrelvir (300 mg/kg, BID) for 3 consecutive days significantly reduced the infectious virus titers in the lungsby 2 and 3.9 log10 TCID50/mg of tissue, respectively, and significantly improved lung pathology. Together, these data demonstrate the validity of this SCID mouse Beta B.1.351 variant infection model as a convenient preclinical model forassessment of potential activity of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCEUnlike the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, the Beta (B.1.351) variant of concern hasbeen reported to replicate to some extent in WT mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Wedemonstrate here that infection of SCID mice with the Beta variant resulted inhigh viral loads in the lungs on day 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir for 3 consecutive days markedly reduced theinfectious virus titers in the lungs and improved lung pathology. The SARS-CoV2SCID mouse infection model, which is ideally suited for antiviral studies, offersan advantage in comparison to other SARS-CoV2 mouse models, in that there is noneed for the use of mouse-adapted virus strains or genetically modified mice.Mouse models also have advantages over hamster models because (i) lower amountsof test drugs are needed, (ii) more animals can be housed in a cage, and (iii)reagents to analyze mouse samples are more readily available than those forhamsters.

TI  - Structural Study of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Identifies a Broad-Spectrum AntibodyThat Neutralizes the Omicron Variant by Disassembling the Spike Trimer.
PG  - e0048022
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00480-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) variants poses new challenges in the fight against the coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The newly emerging Omicron strain causedserious immune escape and raised unprecedented concern all over the world. Thedevelopment of an antibody targeting a conserved and universal epitope isurgently needed. A subset of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against COVID-19 fromconvalescent patients were isolated in our previous study. In this study, weinvestigated the accommodation of these NAbs to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern(VOCs), revealing that IgG 553-49 neutralizes pseudovirus of the SARS-CoV-2Omicron variant. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy(cryo-EM) structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein complexed with threemonoclonal antibodies targeting different epitopes, including 553-49, 553-15, and553-60. Notably, 553-49 targets a novel conserved epitope and neutralizes thevirus by disassembling S trimers. IgG 553-15, an antibody that neutralizes all ofthe VOCs except Omicron, cross-links two S trimers to form a trimer dimer,demonstrating that 553-15 neutralizes the virus by steric hindrance and virionaggregation. These findings suggest the potential to develop 553-49 and otherantibodies targeting this highly conserved epitope as promising therapeuticreagents for COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The emergence of the Omicron strain ofSARS-CoV-2 caused higher immune escape, raising unprecedented concerns about the effectiveness of antibody therapies and vaccines. In this study, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, 553-49, which neutralizes all variants bytargeting a completely conserved novel epitope. In addition, we revealed that IgG553-15 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by cross-linking virions and that 553-60 functions by blocking receptor binding. Comparison of different receptor binding domain(RBD) epitopes revealed that the 553-49 epitope is hidden in the S trimer andkeeps a high degree of conservation during SARS-CoV-2 evolution, making 553-49 a promising therapeutic reagent against the emerging Omicron and future variants ofSARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Neutralization Titers in Vaccinated Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Delta BreakthroughInfections.
PG  - e0199622
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01996-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmission andimmune evasion has caused breakthrough infections in the vaccinated population.It is important to determine the threshold of neutralizing antibody titers (NT50)that permit breakthrough infections in humans. Here, we tested the neutralizationtiters of vaccinated patients who contracted Delta variant. All 64 patients with Delta breakthrough infections exhibited NT50 of less than 70. When thebreakthrough sera were tested against USA-WA1/2020 (a strain isolated in lateJanuary 2020), 82.8%, 15.6%, and 1.6% of them had the NT50 ranges of <20, 20 to50, and 50 to 69, respectively. When the same breakthrough sera were testedagainst Delta-spike SARS-CoV-2, 68.7%, 26.6%, and 4.7% of them had the NT50ranges of <20, 20 to 50, and 50 to 69, respectively. Overall, the results suggestNT50 of 70 as a potential neutralizing threshold required to prevent Deltabreakthrough infections. These clinical laboratory results have implications invaccine strategy and public health policy. IMPORTANCE Given that neutralizingantibodies play a key role in protection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is importantto define the neutralization levels in vaccinated individuals when theycontracted breakthrough infections. In this study, we analyzed the neutralizationlevels from 64 vaccinated patients on days 0 to 5 before they tested positive forDelta breakthrough infections. The neutralization titers in these vaccinatedindividuals were all lower than 70 when they contracted breakthrough infections. The results suggest a neutralization titer of 70 as the potential thresholdrequired to prevent breakthrough infections of Delta variant.

PG  - 1349-1357
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2022.2107602 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has become a global pandemic sinceDecember 2019. Most of the patients are mild or asymptomatic and recovered wellas those suffered from other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection issupposed to demonstrate more sequelae. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among COVID-19 patients and is associated with disease severity and outcomes. Only afew studies focused on a detailed analysis of kidney damage in asymptomatic ormildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Whether any minor viral infection is likelyto exhibit similar minor effect on renal function as COVID-19 is still unclear,and the definite pathophysiology of viral invasion is not fully understood.Currently, the proposed mechanisms of AKI include direct effects of virus onkidney, dysregulated immune response, or as a result of multi-organs failure havebeen proposed. This study will discuss the difference between COVID-19 and other viruses, focusing on proposed mechanisms, biomarkers and whether it matters with clinical significance.

TI  - Perception and Learning Satisfaction of Resident Doctors Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: Adaptation Experience at a Virtual Educational Course in Internal Medicine.
PG  - 678-684
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the perception of the significance of the revision course and satisfaction of resident doctors with the West AfricanCollege of Physicians (WACP) revision course in internal medicine. METHODS: This was a post-training evaluation of resident doctors who had enrolled for the 2021 membership revision course in internal medicine between August 9-13, 2021. Datawere collected through an electronic questionnaire composed of five sections:Sociodemographic characteristics, involvement in research, perception on thesignificance/expectations from the course, lessons learnt, and perception of the overall coordination of the revision course/recommendations. Descriptivestatistics were summarized using frequency tables. Chi-square tests wereconducted to determine the association between participants' sociodemographiccharacteristics and satisfaction with the WACP revision course. RESULTS: The meanage (+/-SD) of the 119 resident doctors was 34.30 (+/- 4.81) years and the medianduration (range) of residency training was 7 (4-10) years. All participants were currently in medical practice either in teaching hospitals (104,87.4%) orsecondary health facilities (15, 12.6%). Overall, 108 (90.8%) doctors weresatisfied with the course. Variables that were associated with satisfaction with the WACP revision course included: duration in residency training (doctors thathad spent two years or less in the residency training programme) (Chi-square =21.703, p = <0.001), place of residency training (teaching hospitals) (Chi-square= 67.461, p = <0.001), and participation in research (Chi-square = 47.976, p =<0.001). CONCLUSION: The WACP revision course in internal medicine met itsobjectives. Engagement of resident doctors in research activities should beundertaken intensely.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 vaccine on clinical characteristics and outcome ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients during the fourth wave of the pandemic in TuzlaCanton, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
LID - 10.17392/1500-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To evaluate clinical and epidemiological characteristics and outcome ofpatients with COVID-19, and impact of vaccine against COVID-19 on them. MethodsThis retrospective study included 225 patients treated from COVID-19 in theperiod from 1 to 30 September 2021 at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases,University Clinical Centre Tuzla (UCC Tuzla). For the diagnosis confirmation ofCovid-19, RTPCR was used. Patients were divided in two groups: fully vaccinatedwith two doses of vaccine, and non-vaccinated or partially vaccinated. Results Of225 patients, 120 (53.3%) were females, and 105 (46.7%) males. Mean age was 65.6 years. There were 26 (11.6%) fully vaccinated patients. Most common symptoms inunvaccinated patients were fatigue (70.9%), cough (70.4%) and fever (69.8%), and in vaccinated fever (76.9%), fatigue (69.2%) and cough (46.2%). Cough was morecommon in unvaccinated patients (p=0.013). Fatal outcome happened in 84 (37.3%)patients. Transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and older age had a higherrisk of death (p<0.001). Older age patients were more likely to havecomorbidities like atrial fibrillation (p=0.017), hypertension (p<001) anddiabetes mellitus (p=0.002). Atrial fibrillation (p<0.001), hypertension(p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.009) and history of stroke (p=0.026), wererelated to fatal outcome in unvaccinated patients, also did a shorter duration ofillness prior to hospitalization (p<0.001) and shorter length of hospitalization (p=0.002). Conclusion Older patients with comorbidities, as well as those whowere not vaccinated against COVID-19, were at higher risk for severe form of the disease and poor outcome.

LID - 10.17392/1490-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To investigate the relationship between adherence to preventive behaviors andrisk of COVID-19 infection. Methods In this case-control study, 491 participants were selected through convenience sampling. First, the samples of the case group (COVID-19 patients) were selected, and then the control group was matched withthe case group based on age, gender, and occupation. The criteria for diagnosing COVID-19 for the case group were self-reported positive PCR test or lunginvolvement on a chest CT scan. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize theresults, and an odds ratio was calculated to quantify the magnitude of theassociation using a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p<0.05. Results Theresults showed that, compared to those who always wear a mask, the risk ofcontracting SARS-CoV-2 was 3.153 times higher in those who used no masks (95% CI:0.953-10.434) and 3.779 times higher in those who used masks occasionally (95%CI:1.929-7.37). The participants who never observed physical distancing andhandwashing were 2.25 times more likely to get COVID-19 than those who alwaysobserved (95% CI:1.719-4.954; OR=2.258). Conclusion Participants who fail infollowing the protective measures, especially wearing a mask regardless of itstype, had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is recommended touse a mask consistently, especially during the peak of COVID-19 waves.

TI  - Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor and Venous Thromboembolism inCOVID-19.
PG  - e025198
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.025198 [doi]
AB  - Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) contributes significantly to COVID-19morbidity and mortality. The urokinase receptor system is involved in theregulation of coagulation. Levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activatorreceptor (suPAR) reflect hyperinflammation and are strongly predictive ofoutcomes in COVID-19. Whether suPAR levels identify patients with COVID-19 atrisk for VTE is unclear. Methods and Results We leveraged a multinationalobservational study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with suPAR and D-dimer levels measured on admission. In 1960 patients (mean age, 58 years; 57% men; 20% Black race), we assessed the association between suPAR and incident VTE (defined as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) using logistic regression andFine-Gray modeling, accounting for the competing risk of death. VTE occurred in163 (8%) patients and was associated with higher suPAR and D-dimer levels. There was a positive association between suPAR and D-dimer (beta=7.34; P=0.002).Adjusted for clinical covariables, including D-dimer, the odds of VTE were 168%higher comparing the third with first suPAR tertiles (adjusted odds ratio, 2.68[95% CI, 1.51-4.75]; P<0.001). Findings were consistent when stratified byD-dimer levels and in survival analysis accounting for death as a competing risk.On the basis of predicted probabilities from random forest, a decision tree foundthe combined D-dimer <1 mg/L and suPAR <11 ng/mL cutoffs, identifying 41% ofpatients with only 3.6% VTE probability. Conclusions Higher suPAR was associated with incident VTE independently of D-dimer in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.Combining suPAR and D-dimer identified patients at low VTE risk.

AB  - One of the most important requirements for the personnel of microbiologicallaboratories working with pathogenic and infectious agents is the observance ofprecautionary measures and the implementation of a set of preventive measures,collectively interpreted as biological safety (biosafety). To a large extent,biosafety problems are also relevant for all clinical laboratories working withbiosubstrates, with the potential threat of containing pathogens of bloodborneinfections in them. On December 30, 2020, the President of the Russian Federationsigned Federal Law numero sign 492 <<On the Biological Safety of the RussianFederation>> (numero sign 492-FZ), which regulates the basic legal norms andregulation of biosafety issues, as well as a list of measures to prevent therisks of the spread of infections due to accidents, bioterrorist acts andsabotage. The current pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 hasdemonstrated, on the one hand, the epidemiological vulnerability of the singleworld space, and on the other hand, the decisive influence of biologicalemergencies on the emergence of negative political and economic processes in the world community. In this regard, the issues of ensuring biosafety in the work of microbiological laboratories in the context of protecting personnel and theenvironment from accidental or unintentional spread of infections are relevant.Working with pathogenic biological agents in microbiological laboratories isconstantly associated with the risk of accidents and possible laboratoryinfection (laboratory-acquired infections) of employees, environmental pollution if the requirements of regulatory documents on biological safety are not met. In accordance with the requirements of numero sign 492-FZ, in order to preventbiological threats, it is necessary to create a system for monitoring biological risks in microbiological laboratories when working with any infected material.

AB  - As of May 17, 2022, more than a million deaths due to COVID-19 have been recordedin the US. For each COVID-19 death, there are an estimated nine bereaved familymembers and an unknown number of bereaved friends. This study aimed to assess thecorrelates of self-reported COVID-19 death exposure (i.e., loss of a close friendor family member) among US adults using online survey data (n = 1,869) collected between September 17, 2021 and October 3, 2021. One in four US adults in thisnational sample reported the loss of a close friend or family member due toCOVID-19. The odds of losing a close friend or family member due to COVID-19death were greater for those age 60 or older, all minoritized racial/ethnicgroups except for Asian American respondents, married/coupled respondents, those who had foregone care due to cost in the past year, and those who reported aCOVID-19 infection.

TI  - A longitudinal qualitative study of the UK general practice workforce experience of COVID-19.
PG  - e45
LID - 10.1017/S1463423622000391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led tosignificant re-organisation of general practice in the United Kingdom and around the world. The general practice workforce has led changes to their services,often dealing with high levels of uncertainty. The way in which manypractitioners consult has shifted significantly, and there has been an increasein the number of phone and online consultations. We know very little about howthose working in general practice experienced the service reorganisationintroduced in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: The aim of thisproject was to describe the changes in the delivery of general practice in theUnited Kingdom in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, toexplore primary care practitioners' and managers' experiences of change withingeneral practice during this time and investigate shifts in perceptions ofprofessional identities. METHOD: We conducted a longitudinal qualitative studythat captured narrative accounts from 17 primary care practitioners and managers across England and Scotland. Each participant submitted narrative accounts in thefirst year of the COVID-19 pandemic using self-recorded or written contributions,or via an interview if preferred. These were analysed using a grounded theoryapproach, with thematic coding used to construct common themes. FINDINGS:Participants' narratives describe the challenges COVID-19 presented to generalpractice. Responses mirror the shifts in the pandemic and its management - froman initial sense of autonomy but uncertainty, to a period of stability andpatients' increasing frustration. The re-organisation of general practice hasaffected practitioners' views of their work and their role as clinicians.Participants' narratives were framed profoundly by the importance of theirrelationships with patients. This analysis of practitioners' and managers'narratives highlights the need for further exploration of how to support thegeneral practice workforce's well-being longer term in a context of increaseddemand and significant change.

TI  - Investigating Organizational Learning and Adaptations for Improved DisasterResponse Towards "Resilient Hospitals:" An Integrative Literature Review.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1017/S1049023X2200108X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For hospitals, learning from disaster response efforts and adaptingorganizational practices can improve resilience in dealing with futuredisruptions. However, amidst global disruptions by climate change, thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and other disasters, hospitals'ability to cope continues to be highly variable. Hence, there are increasingcalls to improve hospitals' capabilities to grow and adapt towards enhancedresilience. AIM: This study aims two-fold: (1) to characterize the current state of knowledge about how hospitals are gaining knowledge from their responses todisasters, and (2) to explore how this knowledge can be applied to informorganizational practices for hospital resilience. METHOD: This study usedPreferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)guidelines for data collection and framework for data analysis, Covidencesoftware, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords relevant to"hospitals," "learn," "disaster response," and "resilience." The qualityappraisal used an adapted version of the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT).RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality appraisal,out of the 420 articles retrieved, 22 articles remained for thematic and content analysis. The thematic analysis included the hospital's functional (operational) and physical (structural and non-structural) sections. The content analysisfollowed nine learning areas (Governance and Leadership, Planning and RiskAssessment, Surveillance and Monitoring, Communication and Network Engagement,Staff Practices and Safety, Equipment and Resources, Facilities andInfrastructure, Novelty and Innovation, and Learning and Evaluation).On applying the Deming cycle, only four studies described a completed learning cycle wherein hospitals adapted their organizational structures using the prior experience and evaluation gained in responding to disaster(s). CONCLUSIONS: There is a gapbetween hospitals' organizational learning and institutionalized practice. Theconceptualized Hybrid Resilience Learning Framework (HRLF) aims to guide thehospitals' decision makers in evaluating organizational resilience andknowledge.In the face of disasters, both the stressful factors and the copingstrategies that affect the health care workers (HCWs) should be substantiallyconsidered.

TI  - Humoral and cellular response of COVID-19 vaccine among solid organ transplantrecipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/tid.13926 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyze the humoral and cellular response to standard andbooster (additional doses) COVID-19 vaccination in solid organ transplantation(SOT) and the risk factors involved for an impaired response. METHODS: We did asystematic review and meta-analysis of studies published up until January 11,2022, that reported immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine among SOT. The study isregistered with PROSPERO, number CRD42022300547 RESULTS: : Of the 1527 studies,112 studies which involved 15391 SOT and 2844 healthy controls were included. SOTshowed a low humoral response [effect size (ES): 0.44(0.40-0.48)] in overall and in control studies [log-Odds-ratio (OR): -4.46 (-8.10 to -2.35)]. The humoralresponse was highest in liver [ES: 0.67(0.61-0.74)] followed by heart [ES:0.45(0.32-0.59)], kidney [ES: 0.40(0.36-0.45)], kidney-pancreas [ES: 0.33(0.13 - 0.53)], and lung [0.27(0.17-0.37)]. The meta-analysis for standard and boosterdose [ES: 0.43(0.39-0.47) versus 0.51(0.43-0.54)] showed a marginal increase of18% efficacy. SOT with prior infection had higher response [ES: 0.94(0.92- 0.96) vs ES: 0.40(0.39-0.41); p-value < 0.01). The seroresponse with mRNA-12723 mRNAwas highest 0.52(0.40-0.64). Mycophenolic acid [OR: 1.42 (1.21 to 1.63)] andBelatacept [OR: 1.89 (1.3 to 2.49)] had highest risk for non-response. SOT had a parallelly decreased cellular response [ES: 0.42(0.32-0.52)] in overall andcontrol studies [OR: -3.12(-0.4.12 to -2.13)] INTERPRETATION: Overall, SOTdevelops a suboptimal response compared to the general population.Immunosuppression including mycophenolic acid, belatacept, and tacrolimus isassociated with decreased response. Booster doses increase the immune response,but further up-gradation in vaccination strategy for SOT is required. Thisarticle is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future pandemics.
LID - 10.1080/14760584.2022.2110075 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vaccination continues to be the most effective method forcontrolling COVID-19 infectious diseases. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 variantscontinue to evolve and emerge, resulting in significant public concerns worldwideeven after more than two years since the COVID-19 pandemic. It is significant to better understand how different COVID-19 vaccine platforms work, why SARS-CoV-2variants continue to emerge, and what options for improving COVID-19 vaccines canbe considered to fight against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future pandemics. AREACOVERED: Here, we reviewed the innate immune sensors in the recognition ofSARS-CoV-2 virus, innate and adaptive immunity including neutralizing antibodies by different COVID-19 vaccines. Efficacy comparison of the several COVID-19vaccine platforms approved to use in humans, concerns about SARS-CoV-2 variantsand breakthrough infections, and the options for developing future COIVD-19vaccines were also covered. EXPERT OPINION: Owing to the continuous emergence of novel pathogens and the re-emergence of variants, safer and more effective newvaccines are needed. This review is also aimed to provide the knowledge basis forthe development of next-generation COVID-19 and pan-coronavirus vaccines toprovide cross-protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants and future coronaviruspandemics.

TI  - Acute kidney injury and its association with mortality in Asian COVID-19patients: A meta-analysis.
LID - 10.5414/CN110899 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonin patients with COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. Moreover, theincidence and mortality of AKI in Asia are ambiguous. OBJECTIVE: Evaluating therisk factors and risk of death from AKI in COVID-19 patients in Asia. MATERIALSAND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical observational studies ofCOVID-19 patients in Asia. Outcome measures included: AKI in COVID-19 patients,overall mortality in COVID-19 patients, and mortality assessment in patients withAKI. The random-effects model was adopted, with heterogeneity and sensitivityanalysis. RESULTS: 27 clinical studies (18,216 Asian patients with COVID-19) havebeen included in the study. The pooled incidence of AKI was 0.19 (95% CI 16 -23%; I2 = 98.9%, p < 0.001); the pooled incidence of total mortality was 0.19(95% CI 17 - 22%; I2 = 98.9%, p < 0.001). No publication bias was found (Egger's test, p = 0.396, 0.213). The pooled mortality in AKI patients with COVID-19 was50% (95% CI 33 - 67%; I2 by random-effects model = 98.4%, p < 0.001). AKI wasfound to be a risk factor for death in stepwise regression analysis; age,diabetes, and hypertension were influencing factors for AKI risk in COVID-19patients. CONCLUSION: AKI is a common complication in Asian COVID-19 patients,and it is associated with an increase in mortality of Asian COVID-19 patients.Any treatment that protects the kidney may be a practical intervention to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients in Asia.

TI  - Use of synchronous kidney and lung extracorporeal support for severe COVID-19: A single-center retrospective study.
LID - 10.5414/CN110793 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with both kidney and respiratory failure.During the early phase of the coronavirus disease pandemic, patients oftenrequired the use of mechanical assistance to provide adequate kidney and lungfunction. In this paper we describe the clinical outcomes of patients whorequired synchronous kidney and lung extracorporeal support for COVID-19.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients admitted to Baylor University Medical Center,Dallas, between February 1, 2020, to April 23, 2021, with COVID-19 who requiredboth extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who were on hemo- orperitoneal dialysis prior to admission or who required veno-arterial (VA) ECMOwere excluded. RESULTS: 35 patients with COVID-19 required ECMO and CRRT support.Four patients (11%) were excluded, 2 due to being on dialysis prior to admission and 2 due to the requirement of VA-ECMO. The median time on CRRT was 33 days (IQR13 - 51). The median time on ECMO was 28 days (IQR 10.5 - 59.5). At 90 days, 9patients had died (29%), 4 patients remained hospitalized, and 18 patients hadbeen discharged: 10 to long-term acute care, 2 to inpatient rehabilitation, and 6to home. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 requiring concurrent ECMO and CRRT in this institution had a 29% mortality at 90 days.

TI  - Assessing the Fit of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Fitted with an Ear Loop Strap System: A Pilot Study.
LID - wxac051 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/annweh/wxac051 [doi]
AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of millions of people worldwide havebecome new users of respiratory protective devices. Facemasks and KN95respirators utilizing an ear loop straps system (ELSS) have recently becomepopular among occupational and non-occupational populations. Part of thispopularity is due to the ease of wearability as compared with traditional devicesutilizing two headbands, one worn over the head and the other behind the neck-auniversal strap system used in NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepiecerespirators (FFRs). Some users convert the two-strap configuration to anadjustable ELSS. The first objective of this pilot study was to quantitativelycharacterize how such a conversion impacts the respirator fit. Additionally, anovel faceseal (NFS) technology, which has been previously demonstrated toenhance the fit of N95 FFRs, was deployed to modify the ELSS-converted N95 FFRs. The second objective of this study was to quantify the fit improvement thatresults from adding the NFS to the ELSS. The study was conducted by performingthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-approved quantitativefit testing (QNFT) on 16 human subjects featuring different facial shapes anddimensions. Three models of cup-shaped N95 FFRs were tested in three versions:the standard version with manufacturer's strap system, the ELSS-converted, andthe ELSS-converted version modified by adding the NFS. QNFT demonstrated that thefit of an N95 FFR featuring the traditional/standard headbands strap system isnegatively impacted when this system is converted to an ELSS. The fit of anELSS-converted respirator can be significantly improved by the addition of theNFS. We found that the FFR model and the strap system version are significantfactors affecting the QNFT-determined respirator fit factor (FF), as well as the OSHA QNFT pass rate (FF >/=100). The findings suggest that the current NFS, iffurther improved, has a potential for developing a 'universally fitting'ELSS-equipped N95 FFR that can be used by the general public, the vast majorityof whom do not have access to OSHA fit requirements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa is aiming to achieve herd immunity against thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the first quarter of 2022. The success of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out depends primarily on the willingness of thepopulation to take the vaccines. AIM: This study aimed to examine the willingnessto take the COVID-19 vaccine, along with the factors of concern, efficacy andpreferences of the individual, which may increase the willingness to bevaccinated. SETTING: This study was conducted at the University of theWitwatersrand, Johannesburg, amongst adult students and academic and professionalstaff. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey from 27 July 2021 to 14 August2021 was conducted. We performed descriptive and inferential analysis todetermine the factors associated with willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine.RESULTS: A total of 2364 participants responded to a survey link and 82.0% werestudents, 66.8% were in the 18-29 years age band and females represented 64.0%. Atotal of 1965 participants (83.3%) were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine,the most preferred vaccines were Pfizer (41%) and JJ (23%), local pharmacy (29%) and General Practitioner (GP) (17%) were the preferred places for vaccination andthe trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were the generalpractitioners (40.6%) and specialists (19.2%). Perceptions that vaccines are safe(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 31.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.02-62.12 foraffirmative agreement) and effective (aOR = 5.92, 95% CI: 2.87-12.19 foraffirmative agreement) were the main determinants of willingness to taking aCOVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: It is imperative to reinforce the message ofCOVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy and to include the GPs and the communitypharmacies in the vaccination roll-out in South Africa.

PG  - e1-e8
LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in early2020, the unemployment rate in South Africa was at its highest in history at29.1%. During the COVID-19 pandemic to date, unemployment rose even higher to35.3%. In this context, there has been an increase in the number of unemployedhealth professionals in South Africa. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determinethe employment rates of newly graduated South African audiologists and identifythe challenges in obtaining and maintaining employment for audiologists in South Africa. METHODS: A descriptive online survey design was used. Participants wererecruited online through professional association webpages using the snowballsampling technique. All qualified audiologists registered with the HealthProfessionals Council of South Africa were eligible to participate. RESULTS: Atotal of 132 audiologists completed the survey. In the first-year postgraduation,16% of the participants were unemployed, and this increased to 19% in thesecond-year postgraduation. In the majority (81%) of employed participants,almost a fifth (19%) were working within non-audiology/healthcare fields. Themost common workplace challenges reported were remuneration (37%) followed bylack of resources (18%), workload (18%), work environment (10%), working hours(9%) and, lastly, interprofessional relationships (8%). CONCLUSION: Findings fromthis study are the first to document employment rates amongst South Africanaudiologists. These findings have the potential to influence the criticaldiscourse on hearing healthcare human resource planning, hearing healthcarelabour capacity and potential for growth in the South African contextpost-COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the learning experiences of first-year speech-language pathology (SLP) students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is essential to ensure that academic staff are able to support and enhance thetransition from secondary to tertiary education. An understanding of the student experience could lead to improved support strategies that could be beneficial forthe blended learning environment that the University of the Witwatersrand will beentering from 2022. OBJECTIVES: This research explored the experiences offirst-year SLP students in online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An exploratory mixed-method concurrent triangulation design was employed.Quantitative data were collected from likert scales. Qualitative data werecollected from critical incident timelines. Themes were identified from both the Likert scales as well as the critical incident timelines using bottom-up thematicanalysis. RESULTS: The majority of participants reflected that their onlinelearning through the pandemic in 2021 was successful. The themes that emergedfrom this year pertain to 2021 and the specific participants however, it providesan important insight that the students' needs change during a year. As alecturer, one needs to consider these evolving needs to ensure students have the support that they require to be successful in their learning. CONCLUSION: Thisresearch provided insights into the evolving nature of the support first-year SLPstudents require in the online learning space during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Health sciences students' perception of the communicative impacts of facecoverings during the COVID-19 pandemic at a South African University.
PG  - e1-e14
LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of face masks and/or shields can pose a challenge duringcommunication. They block facial expressions thus removing visual cues and affectsound transmission making it difficult to hear speech clearly. Given thewidespread use of face coverings, it seems reasonable to clarify if communicationin typical speakers and listeners has significantly differed. Health sciencestudents as future practitioners need to understand challenges that arise fromusing face coverings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine health sciencesstudents' perception of the communicative impacts of face coverings. METHOD: The study employed a descriptive, self-administered online survey, obtaininginformation from 96 health science undergraduate students. RESULTS: Allparticipants changed their manner of speaking in that they spoke louder whenwearing masks and focused more on eye contact when someone was wearing masks.These were statistically significant (p = 0.450 and p = 0.035 respectively).Fifty-three percent reported using more listening effort and feeling anxious whencommunicating. Approximately 33% indicated that it was challenging to reademotions, such as sad or unhappy, when someone wore a mask. Most, 61%, werepositive or very positive about wearing masks. The level of difficulty differeddepending on the listening environment. It was harder to understand the doctor,nurse, or other healthcare workers when they wore face coverings than whenlistening to their friends and family, which had little effect, this beingstatistically significant (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Challenges envisaged inpractice included frequent communication breakdowns, inability to connect andbuild trust between patient and practitioner, and communicating in noisyenvironments. Coping strategies, future clinical and research implications wereproposed, and limitations acknowledged.

PG  - e1-e7
LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.910 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the latest publichealth emergency that has presented challenges globally. Limited evidence exists on the association between COVID-19 and middle ear pathologies, regardless of therespiratory nature of some of the core symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This scoping reviewaimed at exploring evidence on the effects of COVID-19 on middle ear functioning as part of symptom mapping and preventive planning for ear and hearing care.METHOD: Electronic bibliographic databases, including Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Science Direct, ERIC and Scopus, were searched to identify peer reviewedpublications, published in English, between December 2019 and January 2022,related to the effects of COVID-19 on middle ear functioning. The keywords usedas MeSH terms included 'middle ear pathology', 'middle ear disorder', 'otitismedia', 'hearing loss', 'hearing impairment', 'audiology' and 'COVID-19' or'coronavirus'. RESULTS: From eight studies that met the inclusion criteria, thefindings revealed that middle ear pathologies occur in this population, with the occurrence ranging from 1.15% to 75%. Tympanic membrane structural changes,otitis media and conductive hearing loss (CHL) were commonly reported. Thecurrent findings must be interpreted with caution given that most of the studies reviewed had extremely small sample sizes or were case studies or series, thuslimiting generalisability. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the value ofstrategic research planning to collate data during pandemics, ensuring thatfuture studies use appropriate and well-designed methodologies. Trends andpatterns of middle ear pathologies in this population must also be established todetermine the need for periodic monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa's healthcare system has a multitude of pre-existingchallenges prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic, ranging from reduced number of staff, lack of resources and units beingat overcapacity both in the adult and paediatric populations. The neonatalintensive care units (NICUs) require a team approach to ensure best practice withvulnerable infants, but little is known about how the onset of the COVID-19pandemic and the resultant lockdown restrictions impacted the feeding practiceswithin the NICU. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the impact that COVID-19had on the feeding practices within the NICU settings in public hospitals inGauteng. METHODS: A qualitative design was employed with data collected in twoNICUs in Gauteng. Data were collected in the form of observations andsemi-structured interviews with healthcare workers (HCWs) in the NICU. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although the sample size of participants was limited, social distancing proved to be a challenge resulting inmothers and healthcare workers being given restricted access. This had effects onthe ability to provide adequate feeding practices and resulted in anxiety for themothers and mental health challenges for the HCWs when feeding these at-riskinfants. A limitation of this study was the use of only two sites. CONCLUSION:COVID-19 amplified the existing challenges in the NICU. A multidisciplinary andfamily-centred approach to address feeding challenges is required to offset thechallenges resulting from the pandemic and subsequent lockdown.

LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.900 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented and highlighted newand unanticipated challenges to the provision of clinical services, raising anurgency for the application of different models of service delivery, includingtele-audiology. In many tele-audiology encounters, a site facilitator is neededat the patient site to help with the hands-on aspects of procedures, and theimplications of this requirement are significant for the resource-constrainedAfrican context. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this scoping review was to investigatepublished evidence on training provided to patient site facilitators (PSFs) fortele-audiology application to guide the South African audiology community intele-audiology application initiatives. METHOD: Electronic bibliographicdatabases including Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus MEDLINE and ProQuest weresearched to identify peer-reviewed publications, published in English, between2017 and 2021 related to training of PSFs. The guidelines of the PreferredReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) were followedduring the screening process as well as for illustrating the process. RESULTS:Findings are discussed under four key themes: (1) type of tele-audiology and the implications thereof, (2) length of training and its implications, (3) diversity in the range of PSFs used and its implications for the training, and (4)heterogeneity in the training. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight importantconsiderations for tele-audiology application within the African context,specifically decision-making around who can serve in the role of PSFs, as well ascontent and nature of training required, with implications for policy andregulations as well as human resource strategy. These findings are important for the COVID-19 pandemic era and beyond.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented new andunanticipated challenges to the academic training and performance of clinicalresearch at undergraduate and postgraduate levels of training. This highlightedthe need for reimagining research designs and methods to ensure continuedgeneration of knowledge - a core function of a research-intensive university.Whilst adhering to government regulations geared towards protecting both theresearch participants and researchers, innovative research methods are required. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review is to explore published evidence oninnovative clinical research methods and processes employed during COVID-19 andto document challenges encountered and lessons that the fields of Speech-LanguagePathology and Audiology can learn. METHODS: Electronic bibliographic databasesincluding Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, ProQuest were searched toidentify peer-reviewed publications, published in English, between 2019 and 2021,related to innovative clinical research methods and processes applied wherein-person contact is regulated. RESULTS: Significant challenges with conductingresearch in the COVID-19 era were identified, with important lessons learned and numerous opportunities that have relevance for this pandemic era and beyond.These findings are presented under 10 themes that emerged that highlightimportant considerations for research methods and processes during a pandemic andbeyond. The findings of this study also raise implications for telehealth fromwhich low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resource challenges exist, can benefit. CONCLUSION: Challenges and opportunities identified in this reviewhave relevance for the field of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology as far ascurrent and future (beyond COVID-19) clinical research planning is concerned.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to examine how public health policies influenced thedynamics of COVID-19 time-varying reproductive number (R t ) in South Carolinafrom February 26, 2020 to January 1, 2021. METHODS: COVID-19 case series (March6, 2020 - January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 days to approximate the infectiondate. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on R t using EpiEstim.We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case countvaries across counties with different population size. RESULTS: R t shifted from 2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. R t rose over the summer and stayedbetween 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associatedwith a decline in R t (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening,an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%). Less densely populated counties hadhigher attack rate (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The R t dynamics over time indicatedthat public health interventions substantially slowed COVID-19 transmission inSouth Carolina, while their relaxation may have promoted further transmission.Policies encouraging people to stay home, such as closing non-essentialbusinesses, were associated with R t reduction, while policies that encouragedmore movement, such as re-opening schools, were associated with R t increase.

TI  - Can we use temperature measurements to identify pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2infection in nursing home residents?
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17972 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a severe impact on morbidity and mortality amongnursing home (NH) residents. Earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 may position us tobetter mitigate the risk of spread. Both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatictransmission are common in outbreaks, and threshold temperatures, such as 38C,for screening for infection could miss timely detection in the majority ofresidents. We hypothesized that in long-term care residents, temperature trendswith SARS-CoV-2 infection could identify infection in pre-symptomatic individualsearlier than standard screening. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohortstudy using electronic health records in 6176 residents of the VA NHs whounderwent SARS-CoV-2 testing triggered by symptoms. We collected informationabout age and other demographics, baseline temperature, and specificcomorbidities. We created standardized definitions, and a hypothetical model totest measures of temperature variation and compare outcomes to the VA standard ofcare. RESULTS: We showed that a change from baseline of 0.4C identified 47% of NHresidents who became SARS-CoV-2 positive, earlier than standard testing by anaverage of 42.2 h. Temperature variability of 0.5C over 3 days when paired with a37.2C temperature cutoff identified 55% of NH residents who became SARS-CoV-2positive earlier than the standard of care testing by an average of 44.4 h. Achange from baseline temperature of 0.4C when combined with temperaturevariability of 0.7C over 3 days identified 52% of NH residents who becameSARS-CoV-2 positive, earlier than standard testing by an average of 40 h, and by more than 3 days in 22% of the residents. This earlier detection comes at theexpense of triggering 57,793 tests, as compared to the number of trigger testsordered in the VA system of 40,691. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that earlytemperature trends with SARS-CoV-2 infection may identify infection inpre-symptomatic long-term care residents.

AB  - Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS) may exhibit pulmonary fibrosis after the viral illnessresolves. Some of these patients may experience severe functional lungimpairment, and thus require transplants to prevent death or maintain a tolerablequality of life. Considering the reversibility of COVID-19 ARDS, lung transplant candidates are observed for 1-2 months and must be selected very carefully beforetransplantation. As the short-term outcomes of such patients are comparable tothose of patients with other indications for transplantation, lungtransplantation should be actively considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the changes of clinical characteristics and immune-related indicators of patients with mild and moderate acute Omicron variant infection,and to evaluate the protective effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)vaccination. METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the clinicalcharacteristics of 317 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 Omicron variant(B1.1.529) infection admitted to Tianjin First Central Hospital (Shuixi District)from January 22, 2022 to February 24, 2022. Demographic characteristics,vaccination status, underlying diseases, epidemiological characteristics,baseline data, and relevant laboratory test results on admission were collected, and the differences in clinical characteristics, especially the changes inimmune-related indicators, between mild and moderate patients were compared andanalyzed. RESULTS: Among the 317 adult patients with acute Omicron variantinfection, the proportion of elderly, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases were significantly higher in moderate group (203cases) than those of mild group (114 cases) [age >/= 60 years old: 27.58%(56/203) vs. 9.65% (11/114), hypertension: 31.03% (63/203) vs. 19.30% (22/114),diabetes: 15.76% (32/203) vs. 7.89% (9/114), cardiovascular and cerebrovasculardiseases: 11.33% (23/203) vs 0.88% (1/114), all P < 0.05]. The route oftransmission was mainly through gatherings and the first symptoms were fever, drycough, fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose and other flu symptoms;19.30% (22/114) and 24.63% (50/203) of patients in mild and moderate groups were positive for the new coronavirus nucleic acid test, respectively, but thedifference was not significant difference (P > 0.05). Inflammatory indicators in most mild and moderate patients were within normal range, such as white bloodcell count (WBC), neutrophil ratio (NEU%), lymphocyte count (LYM), C-reactiveprotein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), etc., suggestingthat the acute phase of Omicron variant infection had not yet caused severeinflammatory storm, which might be related to the weakening of pathogenicityafter vaccination and virus mutation. The proportion of patients with IL-6 > 7ng/L in the mild group was significantly lower than that in the normal group[1.75% (2/114) vs. 6.40% (13/203), P < 0.05], suggesting that elevated IL-6 mightbe an important factor in evaluating indicators of disease severity. There was nosignificant difference in lymphocyte subsets between the two groups, but therewere 12.90% (12/93) and 11.04% (17/154) of the patients in two groups,respectively, decreased in the proportion of helper T cells, and 18.28% (17/93)and 14.28% (22/154) of the patients had elevated CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, suggesting that patients with Omicron variant infection had autoimmune system dysfunction,which might be related to disease progression and the occurrence of long-termautoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-6 level may be used as a predictor for evaluating the severity of disease in patients with Omicron variant infection;after vaccination, inflammatory indicators in patients with acute Omicron variantinfection were significantly reduced, but the long-term effects still requirelong-term follow-up observation.

Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for common COVID-19and had risk factors for developing severe disease or had pulse oxygen saturation(SpO2) </= 0.93 after exercise without supplementary oxygen were enrolled.Patients were divided into APP group and control group according to whether they completed the daily 12-hours APP in the first three days after enrollment.Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, COVID-19 vaccination status,laboratory examination, disease progression (progression to severe), time tonucleic acid negative conversion, length of hospital stay, and adverse reactions and tolerability [visual analog scale (VAS) score (the higher the score, theworse the tolerability] during APP were evaluated in two groups. Interleukin-6(IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), SpO2/inhaled oxygen concentration (FiO2) ratio and ROX index (ROXI) were compared between two groups at enrollment, 3rd and 7th day after enrollment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences indemographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, vaccination rates of COVID-19 andlaboratory tests between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between two groups at the timeof enrollment. Compared with the group at the time of enrollment, SpO2/FiO2 ratioand ROXI in APP group increased significantly at the 3rd day after enrollment[SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90 (457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (437.14, 457.10), ROXI:25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs. 22.57 (21.86, 24.40), all P < 0.05], and the levels ofIL-6 and CRP in control group were significantly increased [IL-6 (ng/L): 18.30(6.50, 37.75) vs. 7.40 (5.10, 11.15), CRP (mg/L): 11.46 (2.11, 17.96) vs. 4.11(1.72, 9.05), all P < 0.05]. At the 3rd day of enrollment, the levels of IL-6 andCRP in APP group were significantly lower than those in control group [IL-6(ng/L): 7.35 (4.35, 12.80) vs. 18.30 (6.50, 37.75), CRP (mg/L): 4.52 (1.98, 9.66)vs. 11.46 (2.11, 17.96), all P < 0.05], while SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI weresignificantly higher than those in control group [SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90(457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (441.90, 459.52), ROXI: 25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs.23.31 (22.10, 24.66), all P < 0.05]. At the 7th day of enrollment,there were nosignificant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between twogroups. There were no severe cases in both groups. The time of nucleic acidnegative conversion and length of hospital stay in APP group were significantlyshorter than those in control group [10.0 (8.0, 12.0) days vs. 11.0 (9.0, 13.0)days, 12.0 (10.0, 14.0) days vs. 14.0 (12.0,16.0) days, respectively, all P <0.05]. The main adverse reaction during APP was back pain, and the incidence inAPP group was slightly lower than that in control group, but the difference wasnot statistically significant [17.9% (17/95) vs. 26.5% (27/102), P = 0.149]. VAS score in control group was significantly higher than that in APP group [score:2.5 (2.0, 4.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: In common COVID-19patients caused by Omicron variant with high risk factors for progression tosevere disease or decreased oxygen reserve capacity, early APP can shorten thetime of nucleic acid negative conversion and the length of hospital stay, but itseffect on preventing disease progression cannot be determined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients inoculated withdifferent vaccines and underlying diseases, infected with the novel coronavirusOmicron variant. METHODS: The data of 430 patients infected with the novelcoronavirus Omicron variant who were admitted to Tianjin First Center Hospitalfrom January 21, 2022 to March 7, 2022 were collected. A total of 108 patientswith Omicron variant infection with underlying diseases were selected andenrolled. The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), history of underlying diseases,vaccination status (vaccination times, vaccination type), clinical symptoms,laboratory test indicators, imaging data, hospitalization time, nucleic acidnegative conversion time, re-positivity and antibody titer from the two groups ofthe patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In the 108 patients, 93 cases received inactivated vaccine and 15 cases received adenovirus vaccine. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms ofgender, age, BMI, disease types, whether completed the fully vaccinated, whether had prime boost and underlying diseases. Both groups had fever, dry cough, sorethroat, runny nose and other clinical symptoms, but there were no statisticaldifference between the two groups. There were no statistically significantdifferences in laboratory blood routine tests, biochemical indexes, C-reactiveprotein (CRP) level and the results of chest computed tomography (CT) imagingbetween the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences inhospitalization days, nucleic acid negative conversion time, whether admission tointensive care unit (ICU), turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests andimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titer expression between the two groups, butimmunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer in adenovirus group was higher than that ininactivated group (g/L: 229.67+/-26.13 vs. 194.33+/-61.56, P = 0.020). There werealso no significant differences in laboratory examinations, hospitalization days,nucleic acid negative conversion time, turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests andNovel coronavirus antibody titers expression of the patients with booster shotsbetween the inactivated vaccine group and the adenovirus vaccine group.CONCLUSIONS: The protection of inactivated virus vaccine is equivalent toadenovirus vaccine in patients with underlying disease Omicron variant infection,and the titer of IgG antibody in patients with adenovirus vaccine is higher than that in patients with inactivated virus vaccine after one week of recovery.

AB  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic is still in a pandemic state. Aging population with underlying diseases is prone to become severe, and have a higher mortality. The treatment capacity of the critical care department directlydetermines the treatment success rate of critical illness. At present, there isstill a certain gap between domestic and foreign countries in intensive care unit(ICU), which is not only in the allocation of medical staff, but also in the bedsand settings. The current medical model cannot fully meet the needs ofdevelopment. The experience and lessons of many major public health emergenciessuggested that "dual track of peace and war" approach in discipline construction of critical care is the best medical model. Following the concept of "combinationof peace and war", strengthening the discipline construction of critical caredepartment in municipal and district designated hospitals, allocating reasonable standard ICU, step-down ICU and combat readiness ICU, establishing rapid responseteam, and strengthening regular training and scientific management may be the keymeasures to deal with the epidemic.

AB  - Purpose: COVID-19, a novel infection, presented with several complications,including socioeconomical and reproductive health challenges such as erectiledysfunction (ED). The present review summarizes the available shreds of evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on ED.Materials and methods: All publishedpeer-reviewed articles from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to date, relating to ED, were reviewed. Results: Available pieces of evidence that ED is aconsequence of COVID-19 are convincing. COVID-19 and ED share common risk factorssuch as disruption of vascular integrity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cytokine storm, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). COVID-19 also inducesimpaired pulmonary haemodynamics, increased ang II, testicular damage and lowserum testosterone, and reduced arginine-dependent NO bioavailability thatpromotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endothelial dysfunction,resulting in ED. In addition, COVID-19 triggers psychological/mental stress andsuppresses testosterone-dependent dopamine concentration, which contributes toincident ED.Conclusions: In conclusion, COVID-19 exerts a detrimental effect onmale reproductive function, including erectile function. This involves a cascade of events from multiple pathways. As the pandemic dwindles, identifying thelong-term effects of COVID-19-induced ED, and proffering adequate and effectivemeasures in militating against COVID-19-induced ED remains pertinent.

TI  - Effects of boosted mRNA and adenoviral-vectored vaccines on immune responses toomicron BA.1 and BA.2 following the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 vaccination.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28044 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 omicron variant has surged rapidly and raises concerns about immune evasion even in individuals with complete vaccinationbecause it harbors mutations. Here, we examine the capability of boostervaccination following CoronaVac/AZD1222 prime to induce neutralizing antibodies(NAbs) against omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) and T-cell responses. METHODS: A total of 167 participants primed with heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 for 4-5 months wereenrolled to receive AZD1222, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 as a third dose.Reactogenicity was recorded. Immunogenicity analyses of SARS-CoV-2 bindingantibodies were measured using ELISA. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) titersagainst omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were determined using the focus reductionneutralization test (FRNT50) and total interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responseswere measured to observe the T cell activation. RESULTS: A substantial loss inneutralizing potency to omicron variant was found at 4 to 5 months afterreceiving the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222. Following booster vaccination, asignificant increase in binding antibodies and neutralizing activities towarddelta and omicron variants was observed. Neutralization to omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were comparable, showing the highest titers after boosted mRNA-1273 followed byBNT162b2 and AZD1222. In addition, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines developa T cell response to spike protein while those boosted with AZD1222 did not.Reactogenicity was mild to moderate without serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that mRNA booster vaccination is able to overcomewaning immunity to provide antibodies that neutralize omicron BA.1 and BA.2, aswell as a T cell response.

LID - 10.2217/fmb-2022-0006 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationshipbetween lung involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and antibody levels of COVID-19 patients 3and 6 months from the disease. Methods: A total of 156 participants were divided into two groups, Group 1: lung involvement (LI)-positive and Group 2:LI-negative. Biochemical parameters and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were measured. Results: The results showed that mean levels of urea, LDH, CRP,ferritin, neutrophil count and D-dimer were significantly higher in theLI-positive group. In addition, mean antibody levels in the 3rd and 6th monthswere higher in the LI-positive group (p < 0.005). Discussion: High antibodylevels in LI-positive patients correlated with some immunologic and biochemicalparameters. Further studies should be performed to determine protective antibody levels against reinfection, how long protective titers last and the mechanisms bywhich COVID-19 symptoms, demographics and comorbidities may drive higher antibodylevels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent COVID-19 surges are attributed to emergence of moretransmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). The relative severity ofVOCs in children is unknown. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of children </=18 years old diagnosed with COVID-19 from October2020-February 2022 and whose SARS-CoV-2 isolate underwent Illumina sequencing. Wemeasured the frequency of five markers of COVID-19 severity. Logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the odds of each severity marker with each VOC.RESULTS: Among 714 children, 471 (66.0%) were infected with a VOC: 96 (13.4%)alpha, 38 (5.3%) gamma, 119 (16.7%) delta, and 215 (30.1%) omicron. High-riskmedical conditions and increasing age were independently associated with COVID-19severity. After adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, high-risk medical conditions,and COVID-19 community incidence, neither alpha, delta, nor omicron wasassociated with severe COVID-19. Gamma was independently associated withhospitalization (OR 6.7, 95% CI 2.0-22.1); pharmacologic treatment (OR 5.7, 95%CI 1.2-26.8); respiratory support (OR 11.9, 95% CI 2.7-62.4); and severe disease per the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (OR 11.7, 95% CI 2.1-90.5). Upon subgroup analyses, omicron was independently associated with ICU admission and severedisease per the WHO Clinical Progression Scale in children without SARS-CoV-2immunization or prior COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-VOCCOVID-19, the gamma VOC was independently associated with increased COVID-19severity, as was omicron in children without SARS-CoV-2 immunization or priorCOVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and prior COVID-19 prevented severeoutcomes during the omicron surge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: obesity is a risk factor for various diseases and can affect thedisease course. Studies have shown detrimental effects of obesity on patientsaffected with SARS-CoV-2 including increased hospitalization and more severedisease. This study aims to investigate effects of obesity on symptom duration inpatients with COVID-19 and investigate possibility of using BMI as a predictor ofsymptom duration in outpatient settings. METHODS: patients diagnosed withCOVID-19 between June and October 2020 who had no other comorbidities and wereplanned to receive treatment in the outpatient setting were enrolled in thestudy. Duration of the symptoms was determined based on participants' self-reportof their symptoms. Linear regression was used to create predictive models basedon participants' BMI, age, sex, disease presentation, and their self-reportedsymptom duration. RESULTS: 210 patients were included in the final analysis.Patients with higher BMI had significantly longer symptom duration. Linearregression models showed highest correlation between BMI and symptom durationcompared to other covariates. CONCLUSION: low error in predictions and highcoverage of data variability showed BMI can be used as a predictive factor forsymptom duration in COVID-19 patients treated in outpatient settings.

TI  - What happens post-lockdown for people with disability? Autonomy, quality of life,service access and health changes for people with spinal cord injury in Victoria,Australia after COVID-19 social distancing restrictions.
LID - 10.1111/hsc.13958 [doi]
AB  - Social distancing restrictions are undoubtedly important for controlling thespread of COVID-19 however, they are also adversely impacting population healthand health service access. It is important that priority populations with adisability which may already have adverse health, access to health services, and autonomy and participation compared to those without disability, are able toreceive preventative health and social care during periods of restriction. Theimpact of social distancing restrictions on people with disability is not uniformnor well-understood. Research has been cross-sectional and considered datagathered during social distancing restrictions, or longitudinal, considering datagathered during a pre-pandemic baseline. This longitudinal study investigated theimpact of lifting social distancing restrictions on priority domains for peoplewith disability including autonomy and participation, access to health services, health issues and quality of life. People with spinal cord injury in Victoria,Australia (n = 71) completed a survey towards the end of social-distancingrestrictions (T1) and 6-months post social distancing restrictions (T2).Non-parametric tests for significant differences confirmed that 6-monthspost-lifting social distancing restrictions participants experienced asignificant increase in health conditions, a significant decrease in the numberof inaccessible health services, and a significantly lower level of limitationsacross participation and autonomy, outdoor autonomy and work and educationdomains. QOL improved 6-months post lifting restrictions, however not to asignificant level. The adverse health experienced by people with spinal cordinjury after lifting restrictions may in part result from limited health service access and reduced participation during the time of restrictions. Cleardefinitions of what constitutes as essential care may ensure that eligible andrequired care remains received during lockdown or instances when serviceprovision is compromised. Health and social care providers should be equippedwith the knowledge of priority populations so that their support can be targeted to those most in need.

TI  - Evolving strategies in whirlwind mode: The changing face of anatomy educationduring Covid-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1002/ase.2214 [doi]
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic stipulated adoption of unfamiliar strategies for deliveringanatomy education in online mode. The factors which determine educationstrategies are variable across geographical regions. It was perceived than anoverview of education strategies around the globe would be useful for anatomists.Hence this narrative review was undertaken to collate observations from differentgeographical regions pertaining to education strategies adopted during thepandemic. Data relevant to the topic of study were extracted from 12 articlesthat were selected from an initial pool of 317 articles based on search criteria set for the review. Subtle differences in core education strategies implied that baseline response from anatomists were similar across regions. It was evidentthat online digital tools were key elements of education strategies adopted byeducators for delivering online anatomy classes across the globe. Interestingly, a considerable gap in terms of number and variety of online tools used foranatomy education (those requiring commercial purchase) was noted betweeneconomically developed and developing regions. This may have an impact onlearning outcome for students and may even lead to variations in anatomicalknowledge by regions. It was observed that offline human dissection sessions wereincorporated into online practical classes in one region as positive cases showeda declining trend. This positive development is worth emulating elsewhere basedon cautious assessment of prevailing situation. From a broad perspective timelyintroduction of education strategies ensured delivery of anatomy education duringthe pandemic and gave an evolved outlook to the fabric of anatomy education.

AB  - Objective: To compare Anti-Xa directed thromboprophylaxis using low molecularweight heparin (LMWH) (anti-Xa peak goal 0.2-0.5 IU/mL) to alternativeanticoagulation strategies in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: This wasa retrospective, multicenter, single health-system study. Primary outcomes werethromboembolic events and clinically important bleeding events. Secondaryoutcomes included dosing comparisons between LMWH cohorts. Main Results: A total of 695 patients were included. No differences were found in the incidence ofthrombotic events with any of the dosing strategies. The incidence of majorbleeding was significantly higher in the standard dose thromboprophylaxis,intermediate dose subcutaneous heparin (SQH), and therapeutic anticoagulationcohorts. Forty-nine percent of patients within the anti-Xa directed group hadtheir first anti-Xa peak at goal, while 43% were above goal. Patients who hadlevels above goal had dose modifications made, therefore anti-Xa directed LMWHresulted in significantly lower total daily doses compared to intermediate doseLMWH. Conclusions: Anti-Xa directed LMWH dosing provided comparablethromboprophylaxis with lower total daily doses of LMWH in critically illCOVID-19 patients. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm ourfindings.

TI  - BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination Against COVID-19 is Associated with DecreasedLikelihood of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in U.S. Children Ages 5-18 Years.
LID - ciac637 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), linked toantecedent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection, is associated with considerable morbidity. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by vaccination might alsodecrease MIS-C likelihood. METHODS: In a multicenter case-control public healthinvestigation of children ages 5-18 years hospitalized from July 1, 2021 to April7, 2022, we compared the odds of being fully vaccinated (two doses of BNT162b2vaccine >/=28 days before hospital admission) between MIS-C case-patients andhospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. These associationswere examined by age group, timing of vaccination, and periods of Delta andOmicron variant predominance using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Wecompared 304 MIS-C case-patients (280 [92%] unvaccinated) with 502 controls (346 [69%] unvaccinated). MIS-C was associated with decreased likelihood ofvaccination (aOR, 0.16 95% CI, 0.10-0.26), including among children ages 5-11years (aOR, 0.22 95% CI, 0.10-0.52), ages 12-18 years (aOR, 0.10 95% CI,0.05-0.19), and during the Delta (aOR, 0.06 95% CI, 0.02-0.15) and Omicron (aOR, 0.22 95% CI, 0.11-0.42) variant-predominant periods. This association persistedbeyond 120 days after the second dose (aOR, 0.08, 95% CI, 0.03-0.22) in 12-18year-olds. Among all MIS-C case-patients, 187 (62%) required intensive care unit admission and 280 (92%) vaccine-eligible patients were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS:Vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 is associated with reduced likelihood ofMIS-C in children ages 5-18 years. Most vaccine eligible hospitalized patientswith MIS-C were unvaccinated.

TI  - Using mobile phones, WhatsApp and phone interviews to explore how children'shospice nurses manage long-term relationships with parents: a feasibility pilot.
LID - 10.7748/nr.2022.e1849 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phones are familiar to most nurses, but the applicationsavailable for voice recording and transfer of audio files in research may not be.AIM: To provide an overview of a pilot study which trialled the use of mobilephones, WhatsApp and phone interviews as a safe and reliable means of collecting data. DISCUSSION: A pilot study was designed to test the use of: mobile phones asa safe and reliable way to record audio diaries as research data; WhatsApp totransmit the audio files; and phone interviews to explore them. Undertaking thepilot demonstrated that the tools proposed for collecting data were useable andacceptable to the target population and that the researcher's guidance for doing so was satisfactory. CONCLUSION: New technologies enable innovation but triallingthem for useability is important. Confidentiality and consent need to becarefully managed when using WhatsApp to ensure a study is compliant with dataprotection regulations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Collection of research datadigitally and remotely has become increasingly mainstream and relied on duringthe COVID 19 pandemic. The methods discussed in this article provide solutionsfor timely data collection that are particularly useful when the researcher isgeographically distant from participants. The 'in the moment' reflective natureof the audio diaries could also be applicable to non-research settings - forexample, as a method of assisting ongoing professional development and/orcollection of reflective accounts.

PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2022.2109517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omicron variant was featured with high transmissibility and striking antibody evasion. Shanghai has been experiencing Omicron wave since March 2022.Though several studies have evaluated the risk factors of severe infections, the analyses of BA.2 infection risk and protective factors among geriatric people wasmuch limited. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study described clinicalcharacteristics of geriatric Omicron infections (aged more than 60), and assessedrisk and protective factors for severe infections. RESULTS: A total of 1377patients older than 60 were enrolled, with 75.96% had comorbidities. The medianviral shedding time and hospitalization time was 9 and 8 days, respectively.Severe/critical were associated with longer virus clearance time (aOR[95%CI]:0.706(0.533-0.935), P=0.015)), while fully vaccinated/booster andpaxlovid use shortened viral shedding time (1.229 [1.076-1.402], P=0.002; 1.140[.019-1.274], P=0.022, respectively). Older age (>80), cerebrovascular disease,and chronic kidney disease were risk factors of progressing to severe/critical.Fully vaccination was a significant protective factor of severe infections(0.237[0.071-0.793], P=0.019). Further, we found patients with more than twocomorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome in all age groups.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that in the elderly older than 60 yearsold, older age (aged over 80), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidneydisease were risk factors of severe infection. Patients with more than twocomorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome. Fully vaccinated/boosterpatients were less likely to be severe and vaccinations could shorten viralshedding time. The limitation of lacking overall spectrum of COVID-19 infections among elders could be compensated in other larger scale studies in the future.

AB  - Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, French healthcare practitioners seldom usedteleconsultations in France. COVID-19 has brought with it a great need for theuse of teleconsultation and other interventions using digital technology. Thestudy's objective was to identify how French healthcare practitioners usedteleconsultation for obstetrics and gynecology care services before and duringCOVID-19. Our study used a survey of French healthcare practitioners specializingin obstetrics and gynecology from 1 March 2020, to 31 April 2020. We firstdescribed the global picture of the teleconsultation context prior to COVID-19and then during the first lockdown measures. For both contexts, we set up threeaspects: 1- teleconsultation regarding providers' ability; 2- teleconsultationwith regards to its technological features; and 3- teleconsultation for whichtype of healthcare. Second, we mobilized logit models to study the determinantfactors of teleconsultation use as well as what drives provider satisfaction withteleconsultation practice. We show the central role of training, and theimportance of some main digital technology benefits, namely improving publichealth, responding to patients' requests, and facilitating healthcare access. We also exhibit the importance of the limitations specifically related to the lackof convenience in digital technology use and the lack of trust in the digitalservice provided. Our results guide policy makers on suppliers' motivation andneeds for teleconsultation adoption. These results highlight the conditions forefficient use of teleconsultation.

TI  - Enhancing Artificial Intelligence for Twitter-based Public Discourse on FoodSecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 1-25
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Food security during public health emergencies relies on situationalawareness of needs and resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionizedsituational awareness during crises, allowing the allocation of resources toneeds through machine learning algorithms. Limited research exists monitoringTwitter for changes in the food security-related public discourse during theCOVID-19 pandemic. We aim to address that gap with AI by classifying foodsecurity topics on Twitter and showing topic frequency per day. METHODS: Tweetswere scraped from Twitter from January 2020 through December 2021 using foodsecurity keywords. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling wasperformed, followed by time-series analyses on topic frequency per day. RESULTS: 237,107 tweets were scraped and classified into topics, including food needs and resources, emergency preparedness and response, and mental/physical health. Afterthe WHO's pandemic declaration, there were relative increases in topic densityper day regarding food pantries, food banks, economic and food security crises,essential services, and emergency preparedness advice. Threats to food securityin Tigray emerged in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: AI is a powerful yet underused tool tomonitor food insecurity on social media. Machine learning tools to improveemergency response should be prioritized, along with measurement of impact.Further food insecurity word patterns testing, as generated by this research,with supervised machine learning models can accelerate the uptake of these tools by policymakers and aid organizations.

TI  - Measuring work-related risk of COVID-19: comparison of COVID-19 incidence byoccupation and industry - Wisconsin, September 2020-May 2021.
LID - ciac586 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Work-related exposures play an important role in SARS-CoV-2transmission, yet few studies have measured the risk of COVID-19 acrossoccupations and industries. METHODS: During September 2020 - May 2021, theWisconsin Department of Health Services collected occupation and industry data aspart of routine COVID-19 case investigations. Adults aged 18-64 years withconfirmed or probable COVID-19 in Wisconsin were assigned standardized occupationand industry codes. Cumulative incidence rates were weighted for non-response andcalculated using full-time equivalent (FTE) workforce denominators from the 2020 American Community Survey. RESULTS: An estimated 11.6% of workers (347,013 of2.98 million) in Wisconsin, ages 18-64 years, had COVID-19 from September 2020 toMay 2021. The highest incidence by occupation (per 100 full-time equivalents)occurred among personal care and services workers (22.4), healthcarepractitioners and support staff (20.7), and protective services workers (20.7).High risk sub-groups included nursing assistants and personal care aides (28.8), childcare workers (25.8), food and beverage service workers (25.3), personalappearance workers (24.4), and law enforcement workers (24.1). By industry,incidence was highest in healthcare (18.6); the highest risk sub-sectors werenursing care facilities (30.5) and warehousing (28.5). CONCLUSIONS: This analysisrepresents one of the most complete examinations to date of COVID-19 incidence byoccupation and industry. Our approach demonstrates the value of standardizedoccupational data collection by public health, and may be a model for improvedoccupational surveillance elsewhere. Workers at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2exposure may benefit from targeted workplace COVID-19 vaccination and mitigation efforts.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the world. In Canada, the impacthas been worrisome. Canada is a large, sparsely populated country with a systemof universal health care that is decided nationally and enacted by each province and territory. There are variations in health care, as well as in the provisionof social work, throughout the country. The aim of this survey is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social workers employed in health care.Participants were recruited for an online survey via social media, professionalassociations, and social work education programs. Three hundred and seventy-sixsocial workers participated. Analyses were performed to: (1) investigate thechanges in workplace conditions indicated by social workers as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic; (2) examine reported levels of distress, social support,quality of professional life, resilience, and posttraumatic growth amongrespondents during this time; and (3) contextualize these findings by exploringsimilarities and differences across geographic locations. Many respondents weredeemed essential workers. Significant differences across regions were not found. The knowledge generated has important implications for all sectors of the social work profession in Canada.

TI  - The Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Related Medications on COVID-19Severity and Outcome: A Tertiary Referral Center Experience from Turkey.
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2022.22059 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 has become a serious pandemic, and stillremains a risk despite vaccines that have been devel- oped. Among inflammatorybowel disease patients old age, inflammatory bowel disease activation, theexistence of the comorbid dis- ease, and using steroids are known risk factorsfor severe coronavirus disease-2019. But there are different data for drugs otherthan corticosteroids used. The aims of the study are to evaluate the prevalenceand risk factors of severe coronavirus disease-2019 and the effect ofinflammatory bowel disease drugs on severe coronavirus disease-2019. METHODS: In this study among 1195 inflammatory bowel disease patients, 130 patients who were found to be positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between March 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated. Patients were divided into 3 groups asmild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease-2019. RESULTS: Among 130 patients,91 (70%) had mild, 16 (12.3%) had moderate, and 23 (17.7%) had severe coronavirusdisease-2019. Being 60 years of age or older (P = .009), having at least 1comorbid disease (P = .002), and having active inflammatory bowel disease (P =.001) were factors that increased the risk for severe coronavirus disease-2019.The use of mesalazine (P = .35), biologic agents (P = .23), and corticosteroids(P = .42) did not increase the risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019. The useof azathioprine seemed to decrease the risk of severe disease with univariateregression analysis however the significance disappeared with multivariateanalysis. CONCLUSION: Older age, active inflammatory bowel disease, and existenceof at least 1 comorbid disease are risk factors for severe coro- navirusdisease-2019. However, drugs used in inflammatory bowel disease management do notincrease the risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019. But due to the small numberof patients, it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion aboutcorticosteroids.

TI  - Right-Wing Populist Parties' Bordering Narratives in Times of Crisis:Anti-Immigration Discourse in the Genevan Borderland during the COVID-19Pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12516 [doi]
AB  - Right-wing populist parties (RWPPs) view immigration as a threat to nationalidentity and cultural and political cohesion. This paper explores the discourseon immigration of two such parties during a systemic crisis (the COVID-19pandemic) in a borderland area that entails a specific "symbolization" of theborder as a result of geographic proximity. What kind of bordering narrativesoccur in this context, and how do they evolve? To answer these questions, themajor RWPPs operating in the Geneva region were studied: the Genevan SwissPeople's Party and the Geneva Citizens' Movement. Through a critical discourseanalysis, a total of 181 documents published between 1 January and 31 August 2020were analyzed, including the parties' official Facebook posts, press releases,and newspaper articles. Results show that the context of the pandemic favored theemergence of a strong re-bordering narrative.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2-Specific Adaptive Immunity in COVID-19 Survivors With Asthma.
PG  - 947724
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.947724 [doi]
AB  - Background: Asthma patients potentially have impaired adaptive immunity to virus infection. The levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity between COVID-19survivors with and without asthma are presently unclear. Methods: COVID-19survivors (patients with asthma n=11, with allergies n=8, and COVID-19 only n=17)and non-COVID-19 individuals (asthmatic patients n=10 and healthy controls n=9)were included. The COVID-19 patients were followed up at about 8 months and 16months after discharge. The clinical characteristics, lymphocyte subsets, memory T cells, and humoral immunity including SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies,SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, and memory B cells wereanalyzed in these subjects. Results: The strength of virus-specific T cellresponse in COVID-19 survivors was positively correlated with the percentage ofblood eosinophils and Treg cells (r=0.4007, p=0.0188; and r=0.4435, p=0.0086respectively) at 8-month follow-up. There were no statistical differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response between the COVID-19 survivorswith, and without, asthma. Compared to those without asthma, the COVID-19 withasthma survivors had higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies(NAbs) at the 8-month follow-up (p<0.05). Moreover, the level of NAbs in COVID-19survivors was positively correlated with the percentage of Treg and cTfh2 cells(r=0.5037, p=0.002; and r=0.4846, p=0.0141), and negatively correlated with thepercentage of Th1 and Th17 cells (r=-0.5701, p=0.0003; and r=-0.3656, p=0.0308), the ratio of Th1/Th2, Th17/Treg, and cTfh1/cTfh2 cell (r=-0.5356, r=-0.5947,r=-0.4485; all p<0.05). The decay rate of NAbs in the COVID-19 survivors withasthma was not significantly different from that of those without asthma at16-month follow-up. Conclusion: The level of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs in COVID-19survivors with asthma was higher than that of those without asthma at 8-monthfollow-up. The SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity was associated with bloodeosinophils and Treg percentages. The SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity wasclosely associated with cTfh2/cTfh1 imbalance and Treg/Th17 ratio. According tothe findings, asthmatic patients in COVID-19 convalescent period may benefit froman enhanced specific humoral immunity, which associates with skewed Th2/Th1 andTreg/Th17 immune.

AB  - The metabolic characteristics of COVID-19 disease are still largely unknown.Here, 44 patients with COVID-19 (31 mild COVID-19 patients and 13 severe COVID-19patients), 42 healthy controls (HC), and 42 patients with community-acquiredpneumonia (CAP), were involved in the study to assess their serum metabolomicprofiles. We used widely targeted metabolomics based on an ultra-performanceliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The differentiallyexpressed metabolites in the plasma of mild and severe COVID-19 patients, CAPpatients, and HC subjects were screened, and the main metabolic pathways involvedwere analyzed. Multiple mature machine learning algorithms confirmed that themetabolites performed excellently in discriminating COVID-19 groups from CAP and HC subjects, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1. The specific dysregulation of AMP, dGMP, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and carnitine was observed in thesevere COVID-19 group. Moreover, random forest analysis suggested that thesemetabolites could discriminate between severe COVID-19 patients and mild COVID-19patients, with an AUC of 0.921. This study may broaden our understanding ofpathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 and may offer an experimental basis fordeveloping novel treatment strategies against it.

TI  - Case Report: Post-COVID-19 Vaccine Recurrence of Guillain-Barre SyndromeFollowing an Antecedent Parainfectious COVID-19-Related GBS.
PG  - 894872
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.894872 [doi]
AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune neurological disorder oftenpreceded by viral illnesses or, more rarely, vaccinations. We report on a unique combination of postcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine GBS that occurred months after a parainfectious COVID-19-related GBS. Shortly after manifestingCOVID-19 symptoms, a 57-year-old man developed diplopia, right-side facialweakness, and gait instability that, together with electrophysiology andcerebrospinal fluid examinations, led to a diagnosis of post-COVID-19 GBS. Theinvolvement of cranial nerves and IgM seropositivity for ganglioside GD1b werenoteworthy. COVID-19 pneumonia, flaccid tetraparesis, and autonomic dysfunctionprompted his admission to ICU. He recovered after therapy with intravenousimmunoglobulins (IVIg). Six months later, GBS recurred shortly after the firstdose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Again, the GBS diagnosis was confirmed bycerebrospinal fluid and electrophysiology studies. IgM seropositivity extended tomultiple gangliosides, namely for GM3/4, GD1a/b, and GT1b IgM. An IVIg courseprompted complete recovery. This case adds to other previously reportedobservations suggesting a possible causal link between SARS-CoV-2 and GBS.Molecular mimicry and anti-idiotype antibodies might be the underlyingmechanisms. Future COVID-19 vaccinations/revaccinations in patients with previouspara-/post-COVID-19 GBS deserve a reappraisal, especially if they areseropositive for ganglioside antibodies.

PG  - 915927
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2022.915927 [doi]
AB  - The rise of the novel COVID-19 virus has made face masks commonplace items aroundthe globe. Recent research found that face masks significantly impair emotionrecognition on isolated faces. However, faces are rarely seen in isolation andthe body is also a key cue for emotional portrayal. Here, therefore, weinvestigated the impact of face masks on emotion recognition when surveying thefull body. Stimuli expressing anger, happiness, sadness, and fear were selectedfrom the BEAST stimuli set. Masks were added to these images and participantswere asked to recognize the emotion and give a confidence level for that decisionfor both the masked and unmasked stimuli. We found that, contrary to some workviewing faces in isolation, emotion recognition was generally not impaired byface masks when the whole body is present. We did, however, find that whenviewing masked faces, only the recognition of happiness significantly decreasedwhen the whole body was present. In contrast to actual performance, confidencelevels were found to decline during the Mask condition across all emotionalconditions. This research suggests that the impact of masks on emotionrecognition may not be as pronounced as previously thought, as long as the whole body is also visible.

TI  - A Way Forward in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Making the Case for Narrative Competence in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.
PG  - 188-196
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2022-0021PS [doi]
AB  - Each surge of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presented newchallenges to pulmonary and critical care practitioners. Although some of theinitial challenges were somewhat less acute, clinicians now are left to face the physical, emotional, and mental toll of the past 2 years. The pandemic revealed aneed for a more varied skillset, including space for reflection, tolerance ofuncertainty, and humanism. These skills can assist clinicians who are left toheal from the difficulty of caring for patients in the absence of families whowere excluded from the intensive care unit, public distrust of vaccines, andmorgues overtaken by our patients. As pulmonary and critical care medicinepractitioners and educators, we believe that cultivating practices, pedagogies,and institutional structures that foster narrative competence, "the ability toacknowledge, absorb, interpret, and act on the stories and plights of others," inour ourselves, our trainees, and our colleagues, may provide a productive wayforward. In addition to fostering needed skills, this practice can promotenecessary healing as well. This perspective introduces the practice of narrative competence, provides evidence of support for its implementation, and suggestsopportunities for curricular integration.

PG  - 180-187
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2021-0126PS [doi]
AB  - Medical learners are vital to the care of critically ill patients in theintensive care unit (ICU). Although these learners are exposed to the challenges and stresses of acute ICU management, they do not typically experience thebenefits of following ICU patients and families longitudinally after their ICUrotation. Post-ICU clinics and recovery programs may fill this crucial gap intrainee education. These clinics have emerged as an appealing approach topotentially support patient recovery, enhance provider satisfaction, and provide feedback on vital lessons learned in long-term follow-up to improve the qualityof ICU care. Notably, the effect of such a program on trainee education has notbeen explored. In this article, we propose a framework for medical learnerparticipation in post-ICU follow-up based on the Accreditation Council forGraduate Medical Education milestones and discuss the potential benefits,including: education about post-ICU recovery, including post-intensive caresyndrome and post-intensive care syndrome-family; experience in qualityimprovement to enhance ICU care by understanding long-term outcomes; engagementin reflection; and mitigation of compassion fatigue and burnout.

AB  - Background: Evidence shows poor adherence to strategies for reducing morbidityand mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving mechanicalventilation globally. Best practice management relies on training all members of the interprofessional ICU team, each with complementary roles in patientmanagement. Objectives: To develop and evaluate a novel two-phase,train-the-trainer, interprofessional and multicultural "Best Practice Management of the Ventilated ICU Patient" multimodality, simulation-enhanced curriculum for Thai education leaders in critical care. Methods: In phase 1 (Oregon Health andScience University cohort), two groups of nine ICU nurses and one critical carephysician representing experts in critical care and education from a largehospital system in Thailand participated in a weeklong, immersive courseconsisting of didactic, simulation, and in situ immersive sessions focused onbest practice management of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, as well astraining in our educational techniques. Outcomes were assessed with pre- andpostcourse knowledge assessments and overall course evaluation. In phase 2 (Thai cohort), participants from phase 1 returned to Thailand and implemented a lowerfidelity curriculum in two hospitals, using the same pre- and posttest knowledge assessment in 41 participants, before the onset of the coronavirus disease(COVID-19) 6 pandemic. Results: In the Oregon Health and Science Universitycohort, the mean pretest knowledge score was 58.4 +/- 13.2%, with a meanimprovement to 82.5 +/- 11.6% after completion of the course (P , 0.05). Thegreatest improvements were seen in respiratory physiology andadvanced/disease-specific concepts, which demonstrated absolute improvements of30.4% and 30.6%, respectively (P < 0.05). Participants had a high degree ofsatisfaction, with 90% rating the course as "excellent" and .90% reporting thatthe course "greatly improved" their understanding of best practices and comfortin managing mechanical ventilation. The Thai cohort had a mean baseline score of 45.4 +/- 15.0% and a mean improvement to 70.3 +/- 19.1% after training (P <0.05). This cohort also saw the greatest improvement in respiratory physiologyand advanced/disease-specific concepts, with 26.2% and 26.3% absoluteimprovements, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A novel, two-phase,interprofessional, multicultural, simulation-enhanced train-the-trainercurriculum was feasible and effective in improving education in best practicemanagement of mechanically ventilated patients and may be a useful model forimproving the care of ICU patients across the world.

AB  - Purpose: Various parameters have been proposed to predict the outcome of patientswith coronavirus disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility ofthe age-adjusted CCI score and biochemical parameters for predicting outcomes forCOVID-19 patients on admission. Patients and methods: A total of 511 patientswere included in the study. Only swab or serological tests positive patients wereincluded. The clinical characteristics of the patients were compared betweensurvival and non-survival COVID-19 inpatients. Hemoglobin, platelet,sedimentation, creatinine, AST, ALT, LDH, CK, albumin, ferritin, lymphocyte,neutrophil, CRP (1-5;5-10;10-20 x upper limit), procalcitonin (5-10;10-20; > 20 xupper limit), D Dimer (> 2 x upper limit), age, gender, chronic diseases and CCI scores were compared between the two groups. Results: 68 patients died and 443patients survived. Mean age was 74.3+/-7.3 years in survival group and 76.7+/-8.0in nonsurvival group. Age, male sex, ischemic heart disease (CHD), chronic kidneydisease and active malignancy was statistically higher in non-survivor group. Thebiochemical parameters was compared in survival and nonsurvival group. CCI score,AST, LDH, CK, Ferritin, CRP are significantly higher and albumin, lymphocytelevels are significantly lower in nonsurvival group. D-dimer and procalcitoninlevels are significantly higher in nonsurvival group. CCI score and neutrophil,creatinine, ALT, AST, d-dimer and procalcitonin elevations were correlated. Lowalbumin and lymphocyte levels were correlated with the CCI score. There was nosignificant correlation between ferritin, sedimentation, CRP levels and CCIscore. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that anaemia,elevated CRP (> 10-20 x upper limit), procalcitonin (> 5-10 x upper limit), ALT, AST levels and higher CCI score were independent risk factors for mortality inCOVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Anaemia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin levels, ALT, AST levels and higher CCI score were found independent risk factors for mortalityin COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Physical distancing requirements due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic hasincreased the need for broadband internet access. The World Health Organizationdefines social determinants of health as non-medical factors that impact healthoutcomes by affecting the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age. By this definition broadband internet access is a social determinant of health. Digital redlining-the systematic process by which specific groups aredeprived of equal access to digital tools such as the internet-creates inequitiesin access to educational and employment opportunities, as well as healthcare and health information. Although it is known that internet service providerssystematically exclude low-income communities from broadband service, little has been done to stop this discriminatory practice. In this paper, we seek to amplifythe call to action against the practice of digital redlining in the UnitedStates, describe how it contributes to health disparities broadly and within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and use a socio-ecological framework to proposeshort- and long-term actions to address this inequity.

AB  - The involvement of the neurological system by coronavirus has been wellestablished. Since its onset, the systemic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been evolving rapidly and imaging plays a pivotal role indiagnosing the various primary and secondary effects of the disease. As thepandemic continues to defy human civilization, secondary impacts of the diseaseand the treatment given to patients afflicted with the disease have stemmed up.Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is one such potentially dangerous infectionnow commonly seen in COVID-19 patients, especially the ones treated withimmunosuppressants. Early diagnosis is key for COVID-19-associated mucormycosis(CAM), and radiologists should be well aware of its alarming neurologicalmanifestations from the involvement of parenchyma, meninges, vessels, cranialnerves, and skull base. This review highlights the magnetic resonance imagingfeatures of neuraxial involvement in CAM.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 was paralleled by anequally overwhelming publication of scientific literature. This scientometricanalysis was performed to evaluate the 100 most cited articles on COVID-19imaging to highlight research trends and identify common characteristics of themost cited works. A search of the Web of Science database was performed using thekeywords "COVID CT," "COVID Radiograph," and "COVID Imaging" on June 29, 2021.The 100 top cited articles found were arranged in descending order on the basisof citation counts and citations per year and relevant data were recorded. Oursearch revealed a total of 4,862 articles on COVID-19 imaging published in theyears 2020 to 2021. The journal with maximum number of publications ( n = 22),citation count ( n = 8,788), and impact was Radiology . Citations for the top 100articles ranged from 70 to 1,742 with the most cited article authored by A.I. Taoand published in Radiology . Two authors tied at first spot, having maximumimpact, with both having 5 publications and a total of 3,638 citations amongthem. China was the leading country with both the maximum number of publications ( n = 49) and total citations ( n = 13,892), the United States coming second inboth. This study evaluates publication and citation trends in literature andshows that the countries most affected by the pandemic early on have contributed to the majority of the literature. Furthermore, it will help radiologists torefer to the most popular and important article texts on which to base theirunbiased and confident diagnoses.

AB  - What is the tenet upon which the public policy of lockdown by fiat experiencedduring the COVID-19 pandemic is based on? The work approaches this question aboutthe rationale of the mandatory shelter-in-place policy as an interpersonalexchange of rights, but where the exchange occurs coercively instead ofvoluntarily. It compares, in positive political economy terms, the normativeprinciples of utilitarianism and Rawlsianism, and shows that lockdown by fiat is a policy that is closer to a maximin equity criterion rather than to autilitarian one. The work moreover shows, also with the aid of a thoughtexperiment and with factual applications, that the fiat redistribution of rights to liberty in favor of rights to health-from those least affected to those mostaffected by COVID-19-is, in the main, a policy choice that is to be expectedunder certain constraints.

AB  - We argue that institutions are bundles that involve trade-offs in thegovernment's ability to provide public goods that affect public health. Wehypothesize that the institutions underlying economic freedom affect the mix ofdiseases by reducing diseases of poverty relative to diseases of commerce (those associated with free movement of people, such as smallpox or COVID-19). We focus on smallpox and typhoid fever in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in order to build on recent work that make arguments similar to ours,especially the framework Werner Troesken sets forth in The Pox of Liberty. Ourevidence shows that economic freedom, in multiple periods of time and settingsprior to the eradication of smallpox in the second half of the twentieth century,reduced typhoid mortality but had no effect on smallpox deaths. The implicationfor COVID-19 is that the trade-off between fighting the pandemic and preservingeconomic freedom may not be too severe in the short run. However, in the longrun, the wealth benefits from economic freedom are likely to be crucial inreducing vulnerability to diseases of commerce primarily from their impact oncomorbidities (such as diabetes and heart disease). Thus, economic freedom is on balance good for public health, which suggests that it, while requiringtrade-offs, might be the best institutional bundle for dealing with pandemics.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary materialavailable at 10.1007/s10657-021-09704-7.

AB  - Commercial and social entrepreneurs are likely to help communities combat public health crises. Research on responses to pandemics has underappreciated thecritical role of entrepreneurs. In the context of post-disaster response andrecovery, entrepreneurs provide needed goods and services, repair and rebuilddisrupted social networks, and can act as focal points for disaster survivors as they develop their plans to rebuild. During a pandemic, entrepreneurs performsimilarly important economic and social functions. This article highlights these functions, including (1) providing the goods needed to survive and combat thepandemic, (2) performing the services needed so that people can stay productiveand connected during the pandemic, and (3) acting as a source of communitysupport and leadership. It also discusses how entrepreneurs are able to performthese roles despite operating in an environment that constricts the range andnature of entrepreneurial activity. Finally, this article describes a legalregime that will promote entrepreneurship during a pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has not only caused millions to die and even more to losetheir jobs, it has also prompted more governments to simultaneously declare astate of emergency than ever before enabling us to compare their decisions moredirectly. States of emergency usually imply the extension of executive powersthat diminishes the powers of other branches of government, as well as to thecivil liberties of individuals. Here, we analyze the use of emergency provisions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and find that it can be largelyexplained by drawing on political economy. It does, hence, not constitute anexception. We show that many governments have (mis-)used the pandemic as apretext to curtail media freedom. We further show that executive decrees areconsidered as a substitute for states of emergency by many governments.

AB  - From an epidemiological perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic is a public healthcrisis. From an economic perspective, it is an externality and a social cost.Strikingly, almost all economic policy to address the infection externality hasbeen formulated within a Pigovian analysis of implicit taxes and subsidiesdirected by a social planner drawing on social cost-benefit analysis. In thispaper we examine the alternative economic methodology of the externality. We seekto understand how an exchange-focused and institutional analysis provides abetter understanding of how to minimise social cost. Our Coasean framework allowsus to further develop a comparative institutional analysis of the pandemicresponse.

PG  - 105-115
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12482 [doi]
AB  - How did the legal and political-administrative relationship between central andlocal governments of two decentralised states shape their response to COVID-19?Literature and theories on decentralisation argue that federal and decentralised states are less able to respond to crises in a coordinated manner due to theirperceived greater susceptibility to political conflict. Situated within thistheoretical debate and based on the analysis of legal acts, political decisions, and relevant national news media articles between March and August 2020 inGermany and Italy, this research note shows that, counterintuitively, moredecentralisation does not necessarily translate into more legal and politicalstress during pandemic management. In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,Germany, a highly decentralised state, experienced less legal and politicaltensions than the less decentralised Italy. The key to understanding thisvariation lies in different institutional arrangements, complemented by thespecific political cultures of both states.

AB  - Face masks are recommended to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. One ofthe primary benefits of face masks and other coverings is as source controldevices to reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols during coughing,breathing, and speaking. Face shields and neck gaiters have been proposed as analternative to face masks, but information about face shields and neck gaiters assource control devices is limited. We used a cough aerosol simulator with apliable skin headform to propel small aerosol particles (0 to 7 mum) intodifferent face coverings. An N95 respirator blocked 99% (standard deviation (SD) 0.3%) of the cough aerosol, a medical grade procedure mask blocked 59% (SD 6.9%),a 3-ply cotton cloth face mask blocked 51% (SD 7.7%), and a polyester neck gaiterblocked 47% (SD 7.5%) as a single layer and 60% (SD 7.2%) when folded into adouble layer. In contrast, the face shield blocked 2% (SD 15.3%) of the coughaerosol. Our results suggest that face masks and neck gaiters are preferable toface shields as source control devices for cough aerosols.

TI  - Clinical Features and Treatment Outcome of Coronavirus and TuberculosisCo-Infected Patients: A Systematic Review of Case Reports.
PG  - 4037-4046
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S370837 [doi]
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) are among the top ongoing health crises globally. Both cause respiratorydiseases, and the clinical presentations are similar. There is no summarizedinformation about cases of COVID-19 patients with concomitant TB infection fromdifferent settings. Therefore this review aimed to summerize the clinicalfeatures and treatment outcomes of coronavirus and tuberculosis co-infectedpatients. Methods: An electronic search of case reports published between 2020and 2021 was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect.From eligible reports, data were collected for the selected variables. Weanalyzed the collected information using SPSS version 27 software. Descriptivestatistics were computed for the selected variables. Results: A total of 83patient histories were collected from 47 case reports. The majority (80%) of the cases were reported for male patients. The mean age was 42.6 years (3 months to84 years, SD=17.3). Fever was reported in 80% of cases, followed by cough (73.3%)and hypotension (37.1%). Blood cell parameters revealed lymphopenia (52%), lower hemoglobin (30%), elevated CRP (70%), elevated ferritin (28%), and increasedD-dimer (23.4%). Treatment outcome is significantly associated with blood cellcount results (p-0.044) and a rise in blood inflammatory cytokines(p-0.041). The mean days for viral clearance or negative PCR was 23 days (Range 5-82 days) andthe overall mean duration of hospitalization was 27 days. The total death ratewas 22.4%. Recovery was reported for 76.6% of cases. Survival status (p-0.613)and disease severity (p-0.68) are not significantly associated with the gender ofthe participants. Conclusion: An alteration in blood cell parameters isassociated with an unfavorable treatment outcome. There is a higher death rate inCOVID-19/TB co-infection. The death is associated with older age, smoking orsmoking history, drug abuse, and co-morbidity of non-communicable diseases.Conversely, there is a lower death rate in HIV patients.

TI  - The Safety of Same-day Discharge after Immediate Alloplastic BreastReconstruction: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e4448
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004448 [doi]
AB  - Background: Implant-based breast reconstruction can be accomplished in a variety of ways and can result in vastly different postoperative experiences forpatients. The COVID-19 pandemic and recent trends have resulted in a shift towardoutpatient management of these patients. Methods: A systematic review of PubMedand Embase databases was conducted. A total of 1328 articles were identified oninitial search, and after several rounds of review, a total of four met inclusionand exclusion criteria. Manuscripts were included if postmastectomy alloplasticbreast reconstruction was performed, and there was documentation of same-daydischarge. This cohort of patients was compared with traditional, plannedovernight admission cohorts found in the literature. Objective data comparedbetween groups included preoperative patient factors and postoperativecomplication rates. Results: Four studies representing data on a total of 574patients were included: 289 were same-day discharge and 285 were overnightadmission. Patient characteristics of body mass index, radiation, smoking, andbilateral procedures were comparable. Tissue expanders were used more frequently than implants in both cohorts. The rate of overall complications was 33% forsame-day discharge and 34% for overnight admission. Rates of major and minorcomplications, including infection, seroma, and hematoma, were similar. There wasno increase in reoperations or readmissions reported in any of the studies.Conclusions: Same-day discharge after mastectomy with immediate alloplasticreconstruction is a safe approach to treatment in both the ambulatory andhospital setting. There are comparable rates of common complications such asinfection, seroma, and hematoma, with no increase in readmission or reoperation.

TI  - Health Professionals' Knowledge, Attitude and Practices Regarding COVID-19 inDessie City, Northeast Ethiopia: A Facility-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 899808
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.899808 [doi]
AB  - Background: Knowledge and attitudes are among the key drivers of socialbehavioral change. We assessed employed health professionals' (HPs) knowledge,attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 in Dessie city, northeast Ethiopia.Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 HPsworking at Dessie city from 17 to 21 May 2020. The data were collected using aself-administered structured questionnaire. Knowledge, attitude, and practice aremeasured using 19, 16, and 8 questions, respectively. Knowledge and attitudescores are dichotomized at the 3rd quartile, while practice is using the meanvalue. Data entry and analysis were conducted using EpiData Manager 4.2 and SPSS 25, respectively. Three independent logistic regression analyses were carried outto determine the associated factors. We defined significant association at ap-value of < 0.05. Results: Out of 419 participants, 369 (88.1%) have sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19 (95% CI: 85-91). The mean knowledge score is 16.8with a +/- 2.1 SD. Similarly, 355 (84.7%) of the HPs have a favorable attitudetoward COVID-19 (95% CI: 81-87.9). The mean attitude score is 14 with +/- 2.1 SD.However, practice regarding COVID-19 is adequate only in 69.7% (292) of the HPs(95% CI: 65.2-94). The mean practice score is 5.1 with a +/- 1.3 SD. Sufficientknowledge is significantly associated with the type of health facility (AOR: 4.4,95% CI: 1.4-13.3), degree and above education (AOR: 2.6, 95% Cl: 1.4-4.9), radio availability (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.7), and social media utilization (AOR: 2.3,95% CI: 1.1-5.1). The predictors of favorable attitude are training (AOR: 3.1,95% CI: 1.6-6.1), sufficient knowledge (AOR: 5.2, 95% Cl: 2.6-10.4), and type of health facility (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.2). Conclusion: Most HPs have sufficientknowledge and a favorable attitude regarding COVID-19. However, practice isrelatively low and there remains plenty to build assertive preventive behaviors. The gap between knowledge and practice should be narrowed through an appropriate social and behavioral change communication strategy.

TI  - Experience of using a smartphone WeChat applet for dental anxiety assessment and preoperative evaluation: A nationwide multicenter study.
PG  - 900899
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.900899 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Dental anxiety is a multivariate phenomenon that regularly occursduring a dental procedure. Although it may lead to patients' safety concerns and adverse events in routine treatment, it is often ignored. The purpose of thisresearch is to develop a novel WeChat Applet for dental anxiety (WADA) with thefollowing features and aims: (1) to help patients with dental anxiety management;(2) provide patient with a physical status self-evaluation; and(3) provide aplatform for online assessment and tele-consultancy by dentists. We aimed to testand verify whether such an applet could play a beneficial role before and after adental procedure and facilitate management of high-risk patients during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: During the 12-month survey period(August 2020 to July 2021), a total of 180 patients aged 3-74 years from eightdifferent cities (n = 180 at the end of treatment, n = 25 for the SystemUsability Scale (SUS) and follow-up interview) and 20 medical staff from eightdifferent cities (n =20 for follow-up interview) were evaluated by WADA. At theend of the survey period, the results of the interviews were analyzedthematically. Results: WADA assessment results from 180 patients and follow-upinterview results from 45 participants were analyzed. In this study with a maleto female ratio of 2:3, 75% were found to be suffering from dental anxiety, 86%were found with postoperative complications, and 11 cases were found to havecontraindications to surgery. The total SUS score for WADA is 72.25 above themean score, proving that WADA is a relevant and useful tool before and afterdental treatment. Based on the results of the interviews, the following themeswere identified: patient satisfaction; dentists' effectiveness; multi-center dataintegration; and increase its frequency of usage. Conclusions: The WADA wasdeveloped for dental procedures and is effective for reducing treatment risks,improving patients' satisfaction and dentists' convenience, especially in termsof facilitating management of high-risk patient during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives: The design of the supply chain determines how effectively anyvaccination campaign can be operated. This case study of Switzerland's vaccinesupply chain compares its design with public health objectives. It maps thevaccine supply chain in Switzerland as it was set up to handle the firstshipments of Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 to enable a more holistic view of supplyand demand flows. Recommendations are made to improve emergency logistics ofvaccines in the future. Methods: Twenty-six semi-structured interviews withinternational and Swiss stake-holders were coded and analyzed to arrive at adescription of planning and distribution processes. The vaccine supply chainnetwork structure was mapped, linking upstream and downstream flows of materialand information. The visualization of nodes and flows was combined with spatialinformation, including population data. The results are summarized in narrativeform to support decision-makers across disciplines. Results: Despite adequatevaccine supply, abundant local endowments and high investment in infrastructure, the 2021 design of Switzerland's vaccine supply chain reduced the potential reachof target populations. The segmentation of catchment populations, collaborationbetween administrative units and better use of information on geolocation andmaterial flows could have improved the speed and reach of vaccinations during theemergency response phase. Three recommendations are made for supply chainstructures to support higher vaccination rates in the future. Conclusions: Thevisualization identifies design alternatives which could have improvedvaccination rates under the prevailing conditions. A supply chain map providespublic health officials with a shared view of the vaccine supply chain in orderto better match supply with demand. The case study contributes to developedcountry studies. In order to improve public health outcomes in Switzerland,investments to secure supply, strong national endowments, and excellentinfrastructure must be combined with optimized supply chain design.

AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have significantlyaffected health care systems and daily wellbeing. However, the indirect impactsof the pandemic on birth outcomes are not fully understood. We aimed to examinewhether the pandemic altered risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Thisretrospective cohort study included all singleton births during 2016-2020identified in Women's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. We compared birthoutcomes during COVID-19 pandemic (January-December 2020) with before thepandemic (January-December 2016-2019) using Logstic regression adjusted forconfounders. Results: A total of 19,792 and 92,750 births occurred during andbefore the pandemic, respectively. Maternal characteristics were similar between groups, except maternal age was higher in pandemic cohort. We observed areduction in preterm birth (PTB, <37 weeks) during the pandemic [5.9 vs. 5.1%, OR(95%CI) = 0.86 (0.80, 0.92)], but the difference disappeared after multivariable adjustment [adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.02 (0.94, 1.11)]. Moreover, full term infantsborn during the pandemic had lower birth weights than those born before thepandemic [adjusted beta (95% CI) = -17.4 (-23.9, -10.8)]. Consistently, the risksof low birthweight (LBW, <2,500 g) and small for gestational age (SGA, < P10)were increased [LBW: adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.13 (1.02, 1.24); SGA: adjusted OR(95%CI) = 1.11 (1.02, 1.21)], and the risks of macrosomia (>/=4,000 g) and large for gestational age (LGA, >/=P90) were decreased in the pandemic cohort[macrosomia: adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.82 (0.77, 0.88); LGA: adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.73 (0.69, 0.77)]. Conclusion: In this study, we observed no change in pretermbirth and a decrease in birth weight of full term infants during the pandemic in Nanjing, China.

PG  - 844269
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.844269 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Occupational hand dermatitis is common among healthcare workers,with increased incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Irritant contactdermatitis accounts for the majority of occupational hand dermatitis and islargely due to frequent contact with hand hygiene products. Long-term prognosisof occupational contact dermatitis is often very poor. This study aims toidentify and implement suitable workplace interventions to aid in the recovery ofoccupational irritant hand dermatitis among healthcare workers during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A quality improvement (QI) project was performed in atertiary hospital using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model. Healthcare workers seen atthe Occupational Dermatology Clinic from March 2020 to May 2021 for the firsttime for likely occupational irritant dermatitis were targeted for the project.Four workplace interventions were implemented: (a) substitute currentalcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) with a different, gentler ABHR, (b) alternate ABHR with gentle hand wash products, (c) temporary job modification with less clinicalwork (d) switch latex gloves to nitrile gloves. The improvement was assessedafter 2 months of workplace intervention using a visual analogue scale, based on changes seen on photographs taken at the baseline and monthly review. The target improvement was set at 70% after 2 months of workplace interventions. Results: A total of 21 participants were included in the QI project. All participants werefound to have significant improvement in their hand condition. The estimated meanreduction of signs and symptoms was 80% in comparison to their baseline handcondition before intervention. Conclusion: Workplace interventions such assubstituting irritant hand hygiene products with gentler alternatives andtemporary reduction in clinical duties may be useful in improving the recoveryrate of irritant hand dermatitis among healthcare workers. Areas with high handhygiene workload or high incidences of hand dermatitis may opt to implementsystemic workplace changes.

PG  - 878396
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.878396 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of contracting coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19) in their workplace. Infection prevention guidelines and standardoperating procedures were introduced to reduce risk of exposure and preventtransmission. Safe practices during interaction with patients with COVID-19 arecrucial for infection prevention and control (IPC). This study aimed to assessHCWs' compliance to IPC and to determine its association with sociodemographicand organizational factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted between Marchand April 2021 at public healthcare facilities in the east coast of PeninsularMalaysia. HCWs who were involved with COVID-19-related works were invited toparticipate in the online survey. The questionnaire was adapted from the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) Interim Guidance: WHO Risk Assessment and Management ofExposure of Healthcare Workers in the Context of COVID-19. Respondents werecategorized as compliant or non-compliant to IPC. A total of 600 HCWs involved inCOVID-19-related works participated in the survey. Most of them (63.7%) werecompliant to IPC as they responded to all items as "always, as recommended"during interaction with patients with COVID-19. The multivariate analysis showed that non-compliance was significantly associated with working in the emergencydepartment (AOR = 3.16; 95% CI = 1.07-9.31), working as laboratory personnel (AOR= 15.13; 95% CI = 1.36-168.44), health attendant (AOR = 4.42; 95% CI =1.74-11.24), and others (AOR = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.1-12.01), as well as workexperience of more than 10 years (AOR = 4.71; 95% CI = 1.28-17.27). The odds ofnon-compliance among respondents without adequate new norms and personalprotective equipment training were 2.02 (95% CI = 1.08-3.81) more than those withadequate training. Although most of the respondents complied to IPC protocols,compliance status differed according to department, work category, and years ofservice. Ensuring adequate training that will hopefully lead to behavioral changeis crucial to prevent breach in IPC and thus minimize the risk of exposure to andtransmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the scientific community to sharetimely evidence, also in the form of pre-printed papers, not peer reviewed yet.Purpose: To develop an artificial intelligence system for the analysis of thescientific literature by leveraging on recent developments in the field ofArgument Mining. Methodology: Scientific quality criteria were borrowed from two selected Cochrane systematic reviews. Four independent reviewers gave a blindevaluation on a 1-5 scale to 40 papers for each review. These scores were matchedwith the automatic analysis performed by an AM system named MARGOT, whichdetected claims and supporting evidence for the cited papers. Outcomes wereevaluated with inter-rater indices (Cohen's Kappa, Krippendorff's Alpha, s(*)statistics). Results: MARGOT performs differently on the two selected Cochranereviews: the inter-rater indices show a fair-to-moderate agreement of the mostrelevant MARGOT metrics both with Cochrane and the skilled interval scores, with larger values for one of the two reviews. Discussion and conclusions: The noteddiscrepancy could rely on a limitation of the MARGOT system that can be improved;yet, the level of agreement between human reviewers also suggests a differentcomplexity between the two reviews in debating controversial arguments. Thesepreliminary results encourage to expand and deepen the investigation to othertopics and a larger number of highly specialized reviewers, to reduce uncertaintyin the evaluation process, thus supporting the retraining of AM systems.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to elicit the stated job preferences of Chinesemedical staff in the post-pandemic era and identify the relative importance ofdifferent factors in the practice environment. Methods: We used an onlinediscrete choice experiment (DCE) survey instrument to elicit the job preferences of medical staff (doctors and nurses) in tertiary hospitals in Anhui, China.Attributes and levels were generated using qualitative methods, and fourattributes were considered: career development, workload, respect from society,and monthly income. A set of profiles was created using a D-efficient design. Thedata were analyzed considering potential preference heterogeneity, using theconditional logit model and the latent class logit (LCL) model. Results: A total of 789 valid questionnaires were included in the analysis, with an effectiveresponse rate of 73.33%. Career development, workload, respect from society, and monthly income were significant factors that influenced job preferences. Threeclasses were identified based on the LCL model, and preference heterogeneityamong different medical staff was demonstrated. Class 1 (16.17%) and Class 2(43.51%) valued respect from society most, whereas Class 3 (40.32%) prioritizedmonthly income. We found that when respect from society was raised to asatisfactory level (50-75% positive reviews), the probability of medical staffchoosing a certain job increased by 69.9%. Conclusion: Respect from society wasthe most preferred attribute, while workload, monthly income, and careerdevelopment were all key factors in the medical staff's job choices. Theheterogeneity of the medical professionals' preferences shows that effectivepolicy interventions should be customized to accommodate these drive preferences.

Methods: Between 2019 and 2022, publications regarding nursing andCOVID-19 were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection. We conducted an advanced search using the following search query string: TS = ("Novel coronavirus2019" or "Coronavirus disease 2019" or "COVID 19" or "2019-nCOV" or "SARS-CoV-2" or "coronavirus-2") and TS = ("nursing" or "nurse" or "nursing-care" or"midwife"). Bibliometric parameters were extracted, and Microsoft Excel 2010 and VOSviewer were utilized to identify the largest contributors, including prolific authors, institutions, countries, and journals. VOSviewer and CiteSpace were usedto analyze the knowledge network, collaborative maps, hotspots, and trends inthis field. Results: A total of 5,267 papers were published between 2020 and2022. The findings are as follows: the USA, China, and the UK are the top threeprolific countries; the University of Toronto, the Harvard Medical School, theJohns Hopkins University, and the Huazhong University of Science & Technology arethe top four most productive institutions; Gravenstein, Stefan, and White,Elizabeth M. from Brown University (USA) are the most prolific authors; TheInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health is the mostproductive journal; "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "nurse," "mental health," "nursing home," "nursing education," "telemedicine," "vaccine-related issues" are thecentral topics in the past 2 years. Conclusion: Nursing-related research onCOVID-19 has gained considerable attention worldwide. In 2020, the major hottopics included "SARS-CoV-2," "knowledge," "information teaching," "mentalhealth," "psychological problems," and "nursing home." In 2021 and 2022,researchers were also interested in topics such as "nursing students,""telemedicine," and "vaccine-related issues," which require furtherinvestigation.

LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.947569 [doi]
AB  - Background: Social capital is a well-known health determinant with bothrelational and geographic aspects. It can help mitigate adverse events and hasbeen shown to impact behaviors and responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mentalhealth has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, and social capital, may serveto buffer those declines. Methods: Building from this, we assessed whetherpre-pandemic social capital and contemporaneous social policy, which includedindicators of social trust, civic participation, and presence of mask mandates,affected pandemic mental health, measured as the percent of the populationexperiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety at the state level. Results:Generalized social trust and state mask mandates were significantly associatedwith lower levels of depression and anxiety. Conversely, states with greatercivic engagement prior to the pandemic experienced more anxiety and depression.Conclusions: Findings suggest that existing social capital, particularly socialtrust, may protect against anxiety and depression and contribute to communityresilience during times of adversity. States should invest in policies andprograms that increase social trust.

AB  - Background: Systemic immunosuppression characterizing cancer patients represents a concern regarding the efficacy of anti-severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination, and real-world evidence is needed todefine the efficacy and the dynamics of humoral immune response to mRNA-basedanti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Methods: We conducted an observational study thatincluded patients with solid tumors who were candidates for mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy. The primary objective was to monitor the immunologic response to the mRNAanti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in terms of anti-spike antibody levels. All thepatients received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the BNT162b2 vaccine.Healthcare workers served as a control group of healthy subjects. Results: Among the 243 patients included in the present analysis, 208 (85.60%) and 238 (97.94%) resulted seroconverted after the first and the second dose of vaccine,respectively. Only five patients (2.06%) had a negative titer after the seconddose. No significant differences in the rate of seroconversion after two vaccine doses were observed in patients as compared with the control group of healthysubjects. Age and anticancer treatment class had an independent impact on theantibody titer after the second dose of vaccination. In a subgroup of 171patients with available data about the third timepoint, patients receivingimmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors seem to have a higher peak ofantibodies soon after the second dose (3 weeks after), but a more pronounceddecrease at a late timepoint (3 months after). Conclusions: The systemicimmunosuppression characterizing cancer patients did not seem to dramaticallyaffect the humoral response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in our population ofpatients with solid tumors. Further investigation is needed to dissect theinterplay between immunotherapy and longitudinal dynamics of humoral response to mRNA vaccines, as well as to analyze the cellular response to mRNA vaccines incancer patients.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic has a high impact on the health of pregnant womenand healthcare providers worldwide. Objective: This study aims to assessmidwives' knowledge and preparedness in providing maternity care during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical hospital-based study thatincluded 116 midwives, who were working in labor ward, was conducted in theDodoma region of Tanzania from March to June 2021. The Chi-square test andFisher's exact test were used to assess the association between the categoricalvariables. The predictors of midwives' knowledge and preparedness were determinedusing binary logistic regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performedusing SPSS version 23.0; p < .05 was considered to be significant. Results: Ofthe midwives studied, 63 (54.3%) had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 and only30 (25.9%) were adequately prepared on provision of maternal care. Havingdiploma/bachelor level of education (AOR = 2.62, 95%CI = 1.08-6.36, p = .033),being trained on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI = 1.11-12.00, p = .033) and working in urban health facilities (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI = 1.17-13.98, p = .002) were thesignificant determinants of midwives' knowledge on COVID-19. Working at a health center (AOR = 0.19, 95%CI = 0.03-1.32. p = .033), being trained on COVID-19 (AOR = 0.04, 95%CI = 0.01-0.14, p = .000 and having adequate knowledge on COVID-19(AOR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.03-1.32, p = .032) were determinants of midwives'preparedness on provision of maternal care. Conclusion: Knowledge andpreparedness in the provision of maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic werelow. Emphasis should be put on training midwives on IPC when providing maternity care. This may help in preventing the spread of infectious diseases includingCOVID-19 as we observed in the present study.

LID - 10.2147/JIR.S375494 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a multi-organ and multi-system diseasewith high morbidity and mortality in severe cases due to respiratory failure and severe cardiovascular events. However, the various manifestations of neurologicaland psychiatric (N/P) systems of COVID-19 should not be neglected. Some clinical studies have reported a high risk of N/P disorders in COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients and that their outcomes were positively associated with the diseaseseverity. These clinical manifestations could attribute to direct SARS-CoV-2invasion into the central nervous system (CNS), which is often complicated bysystemic hypoxia, the dysfunctional activity of the renin-angiotensin system and other relevant pathological changes. These changes may remain long term and mayeven lead to persistent post-COVID consequences on the CNS, such as memory,attention and focus issues, persistent headaches, lingering loss of smell andtaste, enduring muscle aches and chronic fatigue. Mild confusion and coma areserious adverse outcomes of neuropathological manifestations in COVID-19patients, which could be diversiform and vary at different stages of the clinicalcourse. Although lab investigations and neuro-imaging findings may help quantify the disease's risk, progress and prognosis, large-scale and persistentmulticenter clinical cohort studies are needed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19on the N/P systems. However, we used "Boolean Operators" to search for relevantresearch articles, reviews and clinical trials from PubMed and the ClinicalTrialsdataset for "COVID-19 sequelae of N/P systems during post-COVID periods" with thetime frame from December 2019 to April 2022, only found 42 in 254,716COVID-19-related articles and 2 of 7931 clinical trials involved N/P sequelaeduring post-COVID periods. Due to the increasing number of infected cases and theincessant mutation characteristics of this virus, diagnostic and therapeuticguidelines for N/P manifestations should be further refined.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid-growing interest in theinvestigation of the human microbiota of the upper airways. In fact, the residentmicrobial community of this body district may have an influence on the onset ofSARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical course in terms of presence, symptomseverity, and outcomes. However, several microbiological methodologies areavailable to study the human microbiota, reflecting the extensive fragmentationof methodological approaches. We investigate the impact of two critical stepsthat can induce biases in the downstream analyses, i.e. sampling method andmicrobial DNA extraction kit employed. We observed major discrepancies regarding the total amount of prokaryotic DNA that could be retrieved from a biologicalsample and the proportion between bacterial DNA and human host DNA. Moreover,shotgun DNA sequencing and taxonomic profile reconstruction also revealedcorrelations between sampling methods and the procedures applied for microbialDNA extraction. Based on all the data collected in this study, we formulateindications regarding the most efficient and reliable methodological proceduresfor the metagenomic analyses of the upper airways' microbiota to maximizeaccuracy and reproducibility.

AB  - How should we think about crime deterrence in times of pandemics? The economicanalysis of crime tells us that potential offenders will compare the costs andthe benefits from crime and from innocence and then choose whichever option ismore profitable. We must therefore ask ourselves how this comparison is affected by the outbreak of a pandemic and the policy changes which may accompany it, suchas governmental restrictions, social distancing, and responses to economiccrises. Using insights from law and economics, this paper investigates how thevarious components in the cost-benefit analysis of crime might change during apandemic, focusing on Covid-19 as a test case. Building on classical theoretical models, existing empirical evidence, and behavioral aspects, the analysis revealsthat there are many potentially countervailing effects on crime deterrence. Thepaper thus highlights the need to carefully consider which aspects are applicablegiven the circumstances of the pandemic, as whether crime deterrence willincrease or decrease should depend on the strength of the effects at play.

AB  - Background: Early mobilization in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a hotspot.This study aims to provide a bibliometric perspective of the progress in thisfield. Methods: We extracted publications on ICU early mobilization published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2000 to 2021. VOSviewer was usedto construct co-occurrence and co-citation relationships for authors, references,and keywords; Citespace was used to visualize knowledge mapping of subjectcategories, countries, and keywords with the strongest citation bursts. Results: A total of 4,570 publications were analyzed, with a steady increase inpublications in the field of ICU early mobilization. From a macro perspective,research on ICU early mobilization involves multidisciplinary involvement,including critical care medicine, neurology, and nursing; as for the mesoperspective, the United States is the major contributor. Needham DM andSchweickert WD are the key researchers in this field. Moreover, the core journal is Critical Care Medicine, with the most publications and citations. Themicroscopic level, dominated by references and keywords, illustrates that thehotspot and frontier of research on ICU early mobilization focus on ICU-acquired weakness, delirium, the prognosis of critical illness, and severe COVID-19.Conclusion: This study presents a research landscape of ICU early mobilizationfrom different perspectives. These findings will contribute to a betterunderstanding of the current state of research in critical care medicine andprovide the available information for future research ideas.

LID - 10.2106/JBJS.OA.21.00107 [doi]
AB  - Historically, medical students often match within the same geographic location orto an orthopaedic surgery residency program affiliated with their medical school.The objective of this investigation was to determine differences in geographictrends between orthopaedic residents matching before and during theCoronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This study analyzed 2 groups oforthopaedic residents: Pre-COVID cohort (years 2016-2020) and COVID-impactedcohort (year 2021). A list of accredited orthopaedic surgery residency programs(n = 202) was obtained. Orthopaedic residency program webpages were located(region [n = 4], division [n = 9], state [n = 50]). For each resident, theirmedical school and year of postgraduate training were recorded. Year 2021resident information was obtained from the orthopaedic residency programwebpages, social media accounts, and medical school match lists. Residencyprograms affiliated with a medical school were also assigned. Descriptivestatistics were performed. Two sample Student t tests with Bonferroni correction applied to p-values (alpha < 0.05 significant) were performed. RESULTS: Therewere 4,832 residents analyzed (4,074 in Pre-COVID cohort; 758 in COVID-impactedcohort [758/868 of all positions in 2021 Match]). Statistically significantdifferences were detected between the COVID-impacted cohort (39.6%, p < 0.001)matching in the same state as their medical school (Pre-COVID 33.1%) and theCOVID-impacted cohort (28.0%, p < 0.001) matching to a residency programaffiliated with their medical school (Pre-COVID 21.2%). In the COVID-impactedcohort, students who matched in state matched to their home program morefrequently (69.3%) compared with the Pre-COVID cohort (60.5%). Geographically,there was a difference in the COVID-impacted cohort (52.5%, p < 0.011) matchingin the same division (Pre-COVID 47.5%). No statistically significant differences were identified for residents matching to the same region as their medical school(Pre-COVID 60.1%; COVID-impacted 61%, p = 0.968). CONCLUSION: Residents matching in the same state, in the same division, and to a residency program affiliatedwith their medical school increased significantly in the COVID-impacted cohort.There was no difference between cohorts matching in the same region as theirmedical school. Level of Evidence: Observational/Cross-Sectional.

AB  - The second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused severe infectionswith high mortality. An increase in the cases of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis(CAM) was reported predominantly in India. Commonly present in immunocompromised individuals, mucormycosis is often a life-threatening condition. Confoundingfactors and molecular mechanisms associated with CAM are still not wellunderstood, and there is a need for careful research in this direction. In thisreview, a brief account of the diagnosis, management, and advancement in drugdiscovery for mucormycosis has been provided. Here, we summarize major factorsthat dictate the occurrence of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients through theanalysis of published literature and case reports. Major predisposing factors to mucormycosis appear to be uncontrolled diabetes, steroid therapy, and certaincancers. At the molecular level, increased levels of iron in COVID-19 mightcontribute to mucormycosis. We have also discussed the potential role andregulation of iron metabolism in COVID-19 patients in establishing fungal growth.Other factors including diabetes prevalence and fungal spore burden in India ascontributing factors have also been discussed.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a constant threat to human beings and the world economy for more than two years. Vaccination is the first choice tocontrol and prevent the pandemic. However, an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccineagainst the virus infection is still needed. This study designed and preparedfour kinds of virus-like particles (VLPs) using an insect expression system. Two constructs encoded wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) fused with or without H5N1matrix 1 (M1) (S and SM). The other two constructs contained a codon-optimizedspike gene and/or M1 gene (mS and mSM) based on protein expression, stability,and ADE avoidance. The results showed that the VLP-based vaccine could inducehigh SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in mice, including specific IgG, IgG1, andIgG2a. Moreover, the mSM group has the most robust ability to stimulate humoralimmunity and cellular immunity than the other VLPs, suggesting the mSM is thebest immunogen. Further studies showed that the mSM combined with Al/CpG adjuvantcould stimulate animals to produce sustained high-level antibodies and establish an effective protective barrier to protect mice from challenges withmouse-adapted strain. The vaccine based on mSM and Al/CpG adjuvant is a promisingcandidate vaccine to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: Although coronavirus disease 2019 is causing a variety ofpsychological problems for workers, there are few longitudinal studies on changesin workers' mental health by workplace intervention. This study aimed to evaluatethe change in the prevalence of depression and anxiety according to the activeinvolvement of the workplace. Methods: This study was conducted on 1,978 workers at a workplace who underwent a health screening from January 2019 to August 2020,and classified depression and anxiety disorders using a self-reportquestionnaire. After the first pandemic, the company stopped health screening,took paid leave and telecommuting, and conducted interventions such as operating its own screening clinic. To see if this workplace intervention affects workers' mental health, we conducted generalized estimating equations to compare oddsratio (OR). Results: In the pre-intervention group, 384 people (16.86%) haddepression, and 507 people (22.26%) had anxiety disorder. Based on the OR before intervention, the OR of depression decreased to 0.76 (0.66-0.87) and the OR ofanxiety disorder decreased to 0.73 (0.65-0.82). Conclusions: As a result of this study, it was confirmed that workplace intervention was related to a decrease in depression and anxiety. This study provides basic data to improve workers' mentalhealth according to workplace intervention, and further research is neededaccording to workplace intervention in the future.

AB  - Background: Children and adolescents seem to be less affected by the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease in terms of severity,especially until the increasing spread of the omicron variant in December 2021.Anatomical structures and lower number of exhaled aerosols may in part explainthis phenomenon. In a cohort of healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected children, wecompared exhaled particle counts to gain further insights about the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: In this single-center prospectiveobservational trial, a total of 162 children and adolescents (age 6-17 years), ofwhom 39 were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 123PCR-negative, were included. The 39 PCR-positive children were compared to 39PCR-negative age-matched controls. The data of all PCR-negative children wereanalyzed to determine baseline exhaled particle counts in children. In addition, medical and clinical history was obtained and spirometry was measured. Results:Baseline exhaled particle counts were low in healthy children. Exhaled particlecounts were significantly increased in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive children (median355.0/L; range 81-6955/L), compared to age-matched -negative children (median157.0/L; range 1-533/L; p < 0.001). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive children exhaled significantly higher levels of aerosols than healthy children. Overallchildren had low levels of exhaled particle counts, possibly indicating thatchildren are not the major driver of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) clinical manifestations in children and adolescents are diverse, despite the respiratory condition being themain presentation. Factors such as comorbidities and other respiratory infectionsmay play a role in the initial presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aims to describe theepidemiological aspects, clinical, and laboratory manifestations of pediatricpatients admitted to a tertiary pediatric hospital in Rio de Janeiro, diagnosedwith COVID-19, and compare these with other viral conditions during the firstyear of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: All patients under 18 years of age thatwere admitted with upper airway infection were enrolled and followed up for 30days. The main dependent variable was the laboratorial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2,and independent variables were studied through logistic regression. Results: Atotal of 533 patients were recruited, and 105 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Detection of other viruses occurred in 34% of 264 tested participants. Sixpatients died (two in SARS-CoV-2 infected group). The variables independentlyassociated with COVID-19 were older age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0-1.1), lowerleukocytes count at entry (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-0.9), and contact withsuspected case (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.0-2.6). Patients with COVID-19 presentedhigher odds to be admitted in an intensive care unit (OR = 1.99, 95% CI =1.08-3.66). Conclusions: Even during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several otherrespiratory viruses were present in admitted pediatric patients. Variablesassociated with COVID-19 infection were older age, lower leukocytes count atentry, and a domiciliary suspect contact. Although patients with COVID-19 weremore frequently admitted to ICU, we did not observe higher mortality in thisgroup.

LID - 10.1039/d2sd00076h [doi]
AB  - Graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) biosensors exhibit high sensitivity dueto a large surface-to-volume ratio and the high sensitivity of the Fermi level tothe presence of charged biomolecules near the surface. For most reported GFETbiosensors, bulky external reference electrodes are used which prevent theirfull-scale chip integration and contribute to higher costs per test. In thisstudy, GFET arrays with on-chip integrated liquid electrodes were employed forCOVID-19 detection and functionalized with either antibody or aptamer toselectively bind the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. In the case of theaptamer-functionalized GFET (aptasensor, Apt-GFET), the limit-of-detection (LOD) achieved was about 10(3) particles per mL for virus-like particles (VLPs) inclinical transport medium, outperforming the Ab-GFET biosensor counterpart. Inaddition, the aptasensor achieved a LOD of 160 aM for COVID-19 neutralizingantibodies in serum. The sensors were found to be highly selective, fast(sample-to-result within minutes), and stable (low device-to-device signalvariation; relative standard deviations below 0.5%). A home-built portablereadout electronic unit was employed for simultaneous real-time measurements of12 GFETs per chip. Our successful demonstration of a portable GFET biosensingplatform has high potential for infectious disease detection and otherhealth-care applications.

AB  - There have been multiple reports of the development of de novo or relapse ofglomerular diseases after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. While most of them haveoccurred with the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna/NIAID), there alsohave been reports associated with the vector vaccines (AstraZeneca/ChAdOx1-S)vaccine and the inactivated vaccines. Minimal change disease (MCD) is one of the more common glomerular diseases noted to have been associated with the COVID-19vaccination. We report here 4 more cases of MCD occurring in association with theCOVID-19 vaccine, 3 were de novo cases, and 1 case had a relapse of MCD. We also review all the 41 cases described thus far in the literature and review potentialcommon pathways activated by the vaccination that play a role in the pathogenesisof MCD.

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global crisis. Inthe immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an excessiveinflammatory response in patients, causing an inflammatory cytokine storm insevere cases. Cytokine storm leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome,pulmonary and other multiorgan failure, which is an important cause of COVID-19progression and even death. Among them, activation of inflammatory pathways is a major factor in generating cytokine storms and causing dysregulated immuneresponses, which is closely related to the severity of viral infection.Therefore, elucidation of the inflammatory signaling pathway of SARS-CoV-2 isimportant in providing otential therapeutic targets and treatment strategiesagainst COVID-19. Here, we discuss the major inflammatory pathways in thepathogenesis of COVID-19, including induction, function, and downstreamsignaling, as well as existing and potential interventions targeting thesecytokines or related signaling pathways. We believe that a comprehensiveunderstanding of the regulatory pathways of COVID-19 immune dysregulation andinflammation will help develop better clinical therapy strategies to effectively control inflammatory diseases, such as COVID-19.

AB  - The current study sought to characterize commentary regarding intimate partnerviolence during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic via the Twitter hashtags#DomesticAbuse and #DomesticViolence. A sample of 481 original, English-language tweets containing the hashtag #DomesticAbuse or #DomesticViolence posted acrossfive consecutive weekdays from March 22 to March 27, 2020-during which manyplaces were enacting lockdown mandates-was examined using thematic contentanalyses. Overall, Twitter users commented on potential increased rates of IPV,while adding details about abuse tactics that could be employed by perpetratorsduring the pandemic. Additionally, Twitter users disclosed personal experiencesof IPV victimization. Four themes were identified, including (1) type of domesticviolence (i.e. whether the violence was COVID-specific or general domesticviolence), (2) commentary about IPV (i.e. general reflections, decentralizing andcentralizing survivorhood), (3) perpetrator tactic (i.e. abuse tactic used by theperpetrator), and (4) institutions responsible (i.e. institutions responsible forproviding services to survivors). Overall, the commentary on Twitter reflected aneffort to raise awareness and share informational aid for potentialvictims/survivors of IPV. Data highlight the potential of social media networksin conveniently facilitating the sharing and spreading of useful resources toother users. Future research should examine whether resources shared via Twitter reach individuals who need them and empower individuals to garner support.

AB  - Frictions between work and family life have increased during the COVID-19pandemic, causing negative consequences on the mental health and quality of life of workers. Without validated instruments, it is not possible to determine theimpact of Work-Family and Family-Work conflict. To date, no studies have beenconducted to provide evidence of the validity and reliability of The SurveyWork-Home Interaction Nijmegen (SWING; 22 items) in the population of Argentineworkers. The SWING was administered to 611 Argentine workers of both sexes (73.6%female) aged between 18 and 70 years (M = 35.33; SD = 9.16) selected from anon-probabilistic accidental sampling. The confirmatory factor analysis showedsatisfactory fit indices of the original four-factor model (chi2 = 647.073, gl = 203, CFI = 0.93, GFI = 0.92, NFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.05,AIC = 557.9, BIC = 821.5). The level of reliability was acceptable (alpha between0.68 and 0.86, omega = 0.79-0.89). The relationships of the subscale scores with the engagement and burnout variables were as expected according to previousstudies. Having an instrument adequately adapted to the population of Argentineworkers facilitates the development of studies aimed at evaluating the role ofW-F or F-W interactions and their implications for health and productivity.

TI  - The Impact of Psychological Capital and Social Capital on Residents' MentalHealth and Happiness During COVID-19: Evidence From China.
PG  - 962373
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.962373 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This paper studies the mediating and interactive effects of socialcapital on psychological capital and the feeling of happiness from the impact of COVID-19. Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on people'smental health and affected their hopes for the future. Lifestyle and economicconditions have also been affected and have subsequently impacted people's sense of confidence in life. This could increase the likelihood of many peopledeveloping mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. Therefore, it is vital to study the influence of psychological capital and social capital onpeople's subjective psychology and happiness experiences. Materials and Methods: Using an ordered probit model, this paper studied the independent influence andinteraction between psychological capital and social capital on people'shappiness. The ordered probit model was chosen because subjective well-being(SWB) is an ordered variable. We further used structural equation modeling (SEM) to study the mediating effects of social capital on psychological capital andhappiness. Results: The regression results showed that both psychological capitaland social capital were significantly positively correlated with happiness whencontrolling for other factors. In addition, psychological and social capitalsignificantly interacted, in which the psychological capital promotes the effect of social capital on happiness. Moreover, the effect of psychological capital on happiness was greater than that of social capital, demonstrating that happinessis more greatly influenced by subjective psychological experience. Theinteraction coefficient of psychological and social capital was also significant,showing that the two have mutually reinforcing effects on happiness. Finally,health, income class, real estate, stranger trust, age, and urban householdregistration had significant positive effects on happiness, while the view ofmoney, being female, education had a negative relationship with happiness. TheSEM results showed that the mediating effect of psychological capital onhappiness was partly transmitted through social capital: the total effect ofpsychological capital on happiness was highly significant (p < 0.0001), as wasthe total effect of social capital on happiness (p < 0.0001); however, thecoefficient for psychological capital was greater than that for social capital.Through heterogeneity analysis, we found that the relationship betweenpsychological capital, social capital, and happiness was significantly positivein each sub-sample group. There was also a significant interaction betweenpsychological and social capital for men, women, urban and rural residents, andhigher education background sample groups. However, the interaction was notsignificant in the sample group without higher education. In addition, therelationship between the happiness of rural residents and their educationalbackground and gender was not significant. Conclusion: We found thatpsychological and social capital have significant positive relationships andeffects on happiness. Psychological capital demonstrated both direct and indirectinfluences on happiness, and further strengthens the influence of social capital on happiness. These results support a scheme to emphasize psychological supportduring the COVID-19 pandemic period to enhance the mental health of citizens.

AB  - The global widespread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused shortage of medical face masks and led to developing of various types of cloth masks with different levels of protection and comfort to meet the market demands. Breathing comfort is a significant aspect that should be considered during the design ofcloth masks along with the filtration efficiency; otherwise, the wearer will feelsuffocated. In this work, different types of cotton and polyester knitted fabricsblended with spandex yarns were produced and treated with silver nanoparticles tobe used as antiviral cloth masks. Scanning electron microscope, transmissionelectron microscope, and EDX were used to characterize the silver nanoparticles(AgNPs). Antiviral activity was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus as well. The influence of using different fabric materials, number of layers, and hybridlayers on their air permeability and breathability were investigated to evaluate the comfortability of the cloth masks. Physiological impacts of wearing the clothmasks were evaluated by measuring oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and heart rate of the wearers while doing various activities. The results indicated that AgNPshave low cytotoxicity and considerable efficiency in inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Adding spandex yarns with different count and ratios reduced the porosity and airpermeability of the fabrics. Moreover, the combination of three hybrid layers'mask made of polyester fabric in the outer layer with 100% cotton fabric in theinner layer showed high comfortability associated with high air permeability and breathability. Also, wearing these masks while doing activities showed nosignificant effect on blood oxygen saturation and heart rate of the wearers.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has currently developed into a worldwide threatto humankind. Importantly, patients with severe COVID-19 are believed to have ahigher mortality risk than those with mild conditions. However, despite theurgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies, the biological features and pathogenic mechanisms of severe COVID-19 are poorly understood. Methods: Here,peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from four patients with severeCOVID-19, four patients with mild COVID-19, and four healthy controls wereexamined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We conducted gene expression analysis andVenn diagrams to detect specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) inpatients with severe disease compared with those with mild conditions. GeneOntology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significantbiological processes, and protein-protein interaction networks were constructedto extract hub genes. These hub genes were then subjected to regulatorysignatures and protein-chemical interaction analysis for certain regulatorycheckpoints and identification of potent chemical agents. Finally, to demonstratethe cell type-specific expression of these genes, we performed single-cellRNA-Seq analyses using an online platform. Results: A total of 144 DEGs werespecifically expressed in severe COVID-19, and GO enrichment analysis revealed a significant association of these specific DEGs with autophagy. Hub genes such as MVB12A, CHMP6, STAM, and VPS37B were then found to be most significantly involvedin the biological processes of autophagy at the transcriptome level. In addition,six transcription factors, including SRF, YY1, CREB1, PPARG, NFIC, and GATA2, as well as miRNAs, namely, hsa-mir-1-3p, and potent chemical agents such as coppersulfate and cobalt chloride, may cooperate in regulating the autophagy hub genes.Furthermore, classical monocytes may play a central role in severe COVID-19.Conclusion: We suggest that autophagy plays a crucial role in severe COVID-19.This study might facilitate a more profound knowledge of the biologicalcharacteristics and progression of COVID-19 and the development of noveltherapeutic approaches to achieve a breakthrough in the current COVID-19pandemic.

AB  - Since the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 at the genetic level would help combat COVID-19, particularly for long COVID. We performed a genetic analysis of ACE2 and searched for its common potential singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency >0.05 in bothEuropean and Chinese populations that would contribute to ACE2 gene expressionvariation. We thought that the variation of the ACE2 expression would be animportant biological feature that would strongly affect COVID-19 symptoms, suchas "brain fog", which is highlighted by the fact that ACE2 acts as a majorcellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and is highly expressed in braintissues. Based on the human GTEx gene expression database, we found rs2106809exhibited a significant correlation with the ACE2 expression among multiple brainand artery tissues. This expression correlation was replicated in an independent European brain eQTL database, Braineac. rs2106809*G also displays significantlyhigher frequency in Asian populations than in Europeans and displays a protectiveeffect (p = 0.047) against COVID-19 hospitalization when comparing hospitalizedCOVID-19 cases with non-hospitalized COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 test-negative sampleswith European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Furthermore, we experimentallydemonstrated that rs2106809*G could upregulate the transcriptional activity ofACE2. Therefore, integrative analysis and functional experiment strongly support that ACE2 SNP rs2106809 is a functional brain eQTL and its potential involvement in long COVID, which warrants further investigation.

TI  - Identification of antiviral peptide inhibitors for receptor binding domain ofSARS-CoV-2 omicron and its sub-variants: an in-silico approach.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1007/s13205-022-03258-4 [doi]
AB  - Omicron, a variant of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2, emerged in South Africa inNovember 2021. Omicron has been continuously acquiring a series of new mutations,especially in the spike (S) protein that led to high infectivity andtransmissibility. Peptides targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of thespike protein by which omicron and its variants attach to the host receptor,angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) can block the viral infection at the firststep. This study aims to identify antiviral peptides from the Antiviral peptidedatabase (AVPdb) and HIV-inhibitory peptide database (HIPdb) against the RBD ofomicron by using a molecular docking approach. The lead RBD binder peptidesobtained through molecular docking were screened for allergenicity andphysicochemical criteria (isoelectric point (pI) and net charge) required forpeptide-based drugs. The binding affinity of the best five peptide inhibitorswith the RBD of omicron was validated further by molecular dynamics (MD)simulation. Our result introduces five antiviral peptides, including AVP1056,AVP1059, AVP1225, AVP1801, and HIP755, that may effectively hinder omicron-hostinteractions. It is worth mentioning that all the three major sub-variants ofomicron, BA.1 (B.1.1.529.1), BA.2 (B.1.1.529.2), and BA.3 (B.1.1.529.3), exhibitsconserved ACE-2 interacting residues. Hence, the screened antiviral peptides withsimilar affinity can also interrupt the RBD-mediated invasion of different major sub-variants of omicron. Altogether, these peptides can be considered in thepeptide-based therapeutics development for omicron treatment after furtherexperimentation.

PG  - e26464
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26464 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary cavitation is an atypical finding in COVID-19 patients. In this rarecase report, a 63-year-old woman (35 days from COVID-19 symptom onset) presented to our emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Achest X-ray established right-sided total pneumothorax, hence a tube thoracostomywas performed. Due to a persistent air leak, chest computed tomography wasperformed, which showed areas of lung consolidation and a cavitary mass in theupper lobe of the right lung. The woman undertook a thoracoscopy, whichestablished multiple petechiae on the lung surface and a bronchopleural fistulaof the right lung's upper lobe. The treatment of choice was an atypical lungresection to remove the necrotic cavitary lesion. Histological andmicrobiological examination of the resected lung specimen showed a bland(aseptic) cavitary pulmonary infarct. Pulmonary infarction is a rare cause ofcavitation in COVID-19 patients, nonetheless, something that should be consideredin those presenting with respiratory symptoms or complications during orpost-COVID-19.

TI  - Boosting the Understanding and Approval of Anti-Corona Measures-ReducingExponential Growth Bias and its Effects through Educational Nudges.
PG  - 809-821
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12479 [doi]
AB  - One major problem of compliance with anti-coronavirus measures originates fromthe so-called exponential growth bias, i.e. the cognitive distortion ofsystematically underestimating exponential growth and its consequences. Wereplicate an Amazon MTurk experiment regarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that was conducted in the general US population during the first wave of the pandemic inMarch 2020 dealing with this bias. Using a least-likely-design-approach, we find a similarly strong bias in our sample of German students in November 2020.Nevertheless, this bias can be reduced by one simple educational intervention.Furthermore, participants who received these educational nudges showed aconsiderably higher approval rating for contact restrictions. This effect isrobust to different analytical techniques and the inclusion of controls.Complementing political statements about the exponential spread of the virus -which often only mention the name of the phenomenon - with simple educationalnudges could help the public better understand the need for encroachments onpersonal liberties.

LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000737 [doi]
AB  - Studies comparing outcomes of ICU patients admitted for either COVID-19 orseasonal influenza are limited. Our objective was to describe baseline clinicalprofiles, care procedures, and mortality outcomes by infection status (influenza vs COVID-19) of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Data were extracted from the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris database from September 1, 2016, to April20, 2021. It includes data from the 39 university hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of752 influenza adult patients and 3,465 COVID-19 adult patients received invasive mechanical ventilation in one of the ICUs of the Paris area university hospitals,France. INTERVENTION: The characteristics and outcome by infection status werecompared. Factors associated with mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models after controlling for potential confounders, including infectionstatus. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The median age at admission to the ICU was67 (interquartile range [IQR], 57-77) and 63 yr (IQR, 54-71 yr) for influenza andCOVID-19 patients, respectively. At ICU admission, COVID-19 patients were morefrequently obese, more frequently had diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure,and were less likely to have chronic heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney failure, or active cancer than influenza patients. The overallsurvival at 90 days was 57% for COVID-19 patients and 66% for influenza patients (p < 0.001). In a multivariable Cox model, higher age, organ transplant, severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and chronic kidney failurewere associated with shorter survival, whereas obesity and high blood pressurewere associated with longer survival after invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS:COVID-19 and influenza patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICUdiffered by many characteristics. COVID-19 patients showed lower survivalindependently of potential confounders.

TI  - Adoption and Deadoption of Medications to Treat Hospitalized Patients WithCOVID-19.
PG  - e0727
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000727 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by rapidly evolving evidence regarding the efficacy of different therapies, as well as rapidly evolving healthpolicies in response to that evidence. Data on adoption and deadoption areessential as we learn from this pandemic and prepare for future public healthemergencies. DESIGN: We conducted an observational cohort study in which wedetermined patterns in the use of multiple medications to treat COVID-19:remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, IV corticosteroids, tocilizumab, heparin-basedanticoagulants, and ivermectin. We analyzed changes both overall and withinsubgroups of critically ill versus Noncritically ill patients. SETTING: Data fromOptum's deidentified Claims-Clinical Dataset, which contains multicenterelectronic health record data from U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 2020 to June 2021. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTSAND MAIN RESULTS: Of 141,533 eligible patients, 34,515 (24.4%) required admissionto an ICU, 14,754 (10.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 18,998 (13.4%)died during their hospitalization. Averaged over the entire time period,corticosteroid use was most common (47.0%), followed by remdesivir (33.2%),anticoagulants (19.3%), hydroxychloroquine (7.3%), and tocilizumab (3.4%). Usage patterns varied substantially across treatments. For example, hydroxychloroquine use peaked in March 2020 and leveled off to near zero by June 2020, whereas theuse of remdesivir, corticosteroids, and tocilizumab all increased following pressreleases announcing positive results of large international trials. Ivermectinuse increased slightly over the study period but was extremely rare overall(0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medication treatment patterns evolved reliably in response to emerging evidence and changes in policy. Thesefindings may inform efforts to promote optimal adoption and deadoption oftreatments for acute care conditions.

LID - 10.32607/actanaturae.11652 [doi]
AB  - 1,4-Pyrazine-3-carboxamide-based antiviral compounds have been under intensivestudy for the last 20 years. One of these compounds, favipiravir(6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide, T-705), is approved for use againstthe influenza infection in a number of countries. Now, favipiravir is beingactively used against COVID-19. This review describes the in vivo metabolism offavipiravir, the mechanism of its antiviral activity, clinical findings, toxicproperties, and the chemical synthesis routes for its production. We provide dataon the synthesis and antiviral activity of structural analogs of favipiravir,including nucleosides and nucleotides based on them.

TI  - Risk Perception, Media, and Ordinary People's Intention to Engage inSelf-Protective Behaviors in the Early Stage of COVID-19 Pandemic in China.
PG  - 1459-1471
LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S374889 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study aims to examine how risk perception is associated withengagement in preventative behaviors and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: A cross-sectionalsurvey was conducted in February 2020, eventually obtaining 1613 participants,participants'risk perceptions, demographics (sex, age, education level, maritalstatus, and employment status), as well as their engagement in self-protectivebehaviors and testing were assessed. Results: Risk perception significantlyaffected intention to engage in self-protective behaviors, the more risk peoplefeel, the more likely they intend to take self-protective actions(beta =0.0423; P< 0.01), and simultaneously, people obtaining information on COVID-19 fromOfficial microblogs and public accounts(OMPA) (beta =0.189; P < 0.01)and Onlinewebsites(OW) (beta =0.143; P < 0.1)were more inclined to take self-protectivebehaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also showed that the interaction ofrisk perception and Online websites negatively affected the intention to engagein self-protective behaviors(beta = -0.0374; P < 0.05), and conversely, theinteraction of risk perception and Overseas media(OM) positively affectedself-protective intention(beta = 0.0423; P < 0.1). Conclusion: There was a close relationship between the risk perception and the intention to engage inself-protective behaviors. At the same time, the use of media not only directlyaffected the intention to engage in self-protective behaviors but also moderated the impact of risk perception on the self-protection intention. Specifically,official media directly strengthened the intention to engage in self-protectivebehaviors. Online websites not only directly affected self-protection intentionbut also moderated the effect of risk perception on it. Although overseas mediahad no direct effect on self-protection intention, they moderated the effect ofrisk perception on it. These conclusions have policy implications forgovernments' response to the COVID-19 epidemic.

PG  - 1421-1431
LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S370125 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on thepsychological health and dental practice of oral health-care workers (OHCWs). Thesearch for relevant literature was carried out online using PubMed, Web ofscience, and science direct databases from January 2020 to February 2021. Thosearticles were included that provided complete information about the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic on oral health-care workers during covid-19 and were originalarticles and reviews. Those articles were excluded from the current study thatwas not in English Language and involved case reports/book chapters/shortcommunications. Finally, only 8 articles were selected for the scoping reviewconsidering that complete information regarding the provision of dental care inthe time of COVID-19 was provided. Increased psychological distress (especiallythose with existing comorbidities) was noted among the OHCWs during thispandemic. They had enough knowledge about COVID-19 and showed concern regardingthe future of dentistry. Either complete or partial closure of dental clinics hadintroduced financial constraints among them. However, the majority of them didnot switch their profession. The institutions were not prepared for any suchsituation and no training was conducted to control the spread of COVID-19infection. OHCWs are fully aware of the knowledge regarding COVID-19 and showedconcerns for dentistry and dental health-care workers during this pandemic.Complete or partial closure of dental clinics has had adverse effects on thefuture of dentistry, economically as well as psychologically. Institutions needto upgrade and strengthen their systems to cater to any such situationefficiently. Proper counseling sessions should be conducted for the OHCWs tomonitor, identify and treat the cases found.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is exacerbating the worldwidehealthcare crisis. The pandemic has had an impact on nearly every system of ourbody. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave immediate authorization ofseveral vaccines to avoid critical COVID-19 outcomes following the rapid spreadof the COVID-19. There have only been a few cases of severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination-induced immune thrombocytopenia(ITP) so far. There should be enough information to identify whether somevaccination adverse effects, such as ITP, are caused by the vaccine. This studyaims to determine how common ITP occurs after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,as well as gender, age, symptoms, biomarkers, predicted outcomes, and sequelae.We looked at a number of research and compiled the best evidence of SARS-CoV-2vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia currently available. To find the recommendedreporting items, the search technique included keywords like "Immunethrombocytopenia," "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," and "Vaccination." The searchresults were grouped using Boolean operators ("OR," "AND").

PG  - e26500
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26500 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted all routinehealth care services and resulted in a significant reconfiguration of urologiccancer services and care pathways across the globe. This study aimed toretrospectively determine the pandemic's impact on the urologic oncologicalsurgery outcomes at a high-volume referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wecompared the number and histopathological outcomes of urologic oncologicalprocedures in a referral center coded during the pandemic and data of the period before the pandemic as control. Data were extracted from patient files andhospital records. The pathological examination included a completehistopathological staging according to TNM stage. RESULTS: A total of 683patients were included in the study, 424 (62%) of which were operated in thepre-pandemic period. There was a 39% decline in urologic oncological surgicalactivity in the pandemic, mostly in renal and prostate cancer. The mean tumorsize was larger in renal cancer patients who underwent surgery during thepandemic (5.6 cm vs 4.5 cm, p=0.002). During the pandemic, more lymph nodeinvolvement was seen after radical cystectomy and prostatectomy (50% vs 27.8%,p=0.024 and 12.5% vs 4.5%, p=0.026, respectively). No differences in terms ofmain pathologic features were observed in patients undergoing radicalorchiectomy. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appeared to adversely effect oncologic outcomesin patiens undergone surgery for prostate and bladder cancer. Tumor developmentinduced by a delay in diagnosis may cause severe consequences for patients.Reprioritizion of non-deferrable urologic oncological seems crucial.

AB  - The knowledge about COVID-19 infection and sequelae is evolving. Acuteeosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is not a well-recognized complication of COVID-19infection, with few cases reported in the literature. We report a case of a60-year-old male with a history of an orthotopic heart transplant on chronicimmunosuppression who had AEP three weeks after a COVID-19 infection. Hepresented with diarrhea and acute kidney injury without respiratory symptoms.After discharge, the patient experienced progressive fevers, dyspnea, and coughresulting in a second admission to the hospital with acute hypoxic respiratoryfailure requiring supplemental oxygen. Imaging demonstrated ground-glassopacities with areas of consolidation and bronchoalveolar lavage fluiddemonstrated AEP. The patient was treated with steroids resulting in theresolution of his symptoms and radiographic findings. This case highlights thepotential for AEP to complicate COVID-19 infections.

PG  - 904760
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.904760 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 crisis created a lot of problems in people's lives.Different lifestyles, mental health, communication, rituals and traditions,particularly those involved in mourning, have changed drastically. Medical staff faced numerous critically ill patients every day. This greatly distressed thestaff, especially the ICU staff. The end result was considerable amounts ofmental distress for the medical staff who lost family members to COVID-19 making the distress even more complex. Methods: We carried out this qualitative researchto study the grief experiences of 12 Iranian ICU staff members at the RasoulAkram Hospital who had experienced the loss of a family member to the COVID-19pandemic. We studied the effects of how their own grief experience and howconstant exposure to critically ill patients influenced their work with patients.All semi-structured interviews were held in the presence of a faculty member ofthe psychiatry department of Iran University of Medical Sciences. The interviewon the grief experience among ICU staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, consists of4 issues: Familiarity, Experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, Grieving the lossof a family member and Effects of parallel grief. Results: We found five commonthemes in the result of the experiences of the participants based on contentanalysis. These consisted of: complex grieving process, new experiences forcoping with loss, more empathy for patients, change the meaning of death, and theneed for support in work places. Likewise, there were 22 sub themes. Conclusion: Paying attention to the details of staff members' life, gender differences, andcultural aspects can give us a better understanding and perception of their griefexperiences. This understanding brings out valuable points which can help policy makers pass better laws for the wellbeing of society and people in order topromote leadership in turbulent times.

TI  - A bibliometrics analysis and visualization of autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 884600
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.884600 [doi]
AB  - Background: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) increased rapidly inthe last 20 years. Although related research has developed rapidly, little isknown about its etiology, diagnostic marker, or drug treatment, which forcesresearchers to review and summarize its development process and look for thefuture development direction. Methods: We used bibliometrics to analyze papers ofASD in the Web of Science from 1998 to 2021, to draw the network of authors,institutions, countries, and keywords in the ASD field, and visualize theresults. Results: A total of 40,597 papers were included with a continuallyincreasing trend. It turns out that the research on ASD is mainly concentrated inuniversities. The United States has the largest number of ASD studies, followedby England and Canada. The quality of papers related to ASD is generally high,which shows that ASD research has become a hot spot of scientific research. Thekeywords of ASD etiology and diagnostic markers can be classified into at least 7aspects. The detection of keywords shows that ASD research is mostly based on itssubtypes, takes children as the study population, focuses on neurodevelopmentalimaging or genetics, and pays attention to individual differences. And ASDresearch has changed greatly under the impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in thepast 2 years. Conclusion: We consider the future development direction should be based on the improvement of case identification, accurate clinical phenotype,large-scale cohort study, the discovery of ASD etiology and diagnostic markers,drug randomized controlled trials, and telehealth.

TI  - Use of Modeling to Inform Decision Making in North Carolina during the COVID-19Pandemic: A Qualitative Study.
PG  - 23814683221116362
LID - 10.1177/23814683221116362 [doi]
AB  - Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has popularized computer-based decision-supportmodels, which are commonly used to inform decision making amidst complexity.Understanding what organizational decision makers prefer from these models isneeded to inform model development during this and future crises. Methods. Werecruited and interviewed decision makers from North Carolina across 9 sectors tounderstand organizational decision-making processes during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 44). For this study, we identified and analyzed a subsetof responses from interviewees (n = 19) who reported using modeling to informdecision making. We used conventional content analysis to analyze themes fromthis convenience sample with respect to the source of models and theirapplications, the value of modeling and recommended applications, and hesitanciestoward the use of models. Results. Models were used to compare trends in disease spread across localities, estimate the effects of social distancing policies, andallocate scarce resources, with some interviewees depending on multiple models.Decision makers desired more granular models, capable of projecting diseasespread within subpopulations and estimating where local outbreaks could occur,and incorporating a broad set of outcomes, such as social well-being. Hesitanciesto the use of modeling included doubts that models could reflect nuances of humanbehavior, concerns about the quality of data used in models, and the limitedamount of modeling specific to the local context. Conclusions. Decision makersperceived modeling as valuable for informing organizational decisions yetdescribed varied ability and willingness to use models for this purpose. Thesedata present an opportunity to educate organizational decision makers on themerits of decision-support modeling and to inform modeling teams on how to build more responsive models that address the needs of organizational decision makers. Highlights: Organizations from a diversity of sectors across North Carolina(including public health, education, business, government, religion, and publicsafety) have used decision-support modeling to inform decision making duringCOVID-19.Decision makers wish for models to project the spread of disease,especially at the local level (e.g., individual cities and counties), and to helpestimate the outcomes of policies.Some organizational decision makers arehesitant to use modeling to inform their decisions, stemming from doubts thatmodels could reflect nuances of human behavior, concerns about the accuracy andprecision of data used in models, and the limited amount of modeling available atthe local level.

PG  - e210217
LID - 10.1148/ryai.210217 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To conduct a prospective observational study across 12 U.S. hospitals toevaluate real-time performance of an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI)model to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods: A total of 95 363 chest radiographs were included in model training, external validation,and real-time validation. The model was deployed as a clinical decision supportsystem, and performance was prospectively evaluated. There were 5335 totalreal-time predictions and a COVID-19 prevalence of 4.8% (258 of 5335). Modelperformance was assessed with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis, precision-recall curves, and F1 score. Logistic regression was used to evaluatethe association of race and sex with AI model diagnostic accuracy. To comparemodel accuracy with the performance of board-certified radiologists, a thirddataset of 1638 images was read independently by two radiologists. Results:Participants positive for COVID-19 had higher COVID-19 diagnostic scores thanparticipants negative for COVID-19 (median, 0.1 [IQR, 0.0-0.8] vs 0.0 [IQR,0.0-0.1], respectively; P < .001). Real-time model performance was unchanged over19 weeks of implementation (area under the receiver operating characteristiccurve, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.73). Model sensitivity was higher in men than women (P = .01), whereas model specificity was higher in women (P = .001). Sensitivity was higher for Asian (P = .002) and Black (P = .046) participants compared withWhite participants. The COVID-19 AI diagnostic system had worse accuracy (63.5%correct) compared with radiologist predictions (radiologist 1 = 67.8% correct,radiologist 2 = 68.6% correct; McNemar P < .001 for both). Conclusion: AI-basedtools have not yet reached full diagnostic potential for COVID-19 andunderperform compared with radiologist prediction.Keywords: Diagnosis,Classification, Application Domain, Infection, Lung Supplemental material isavailable for this article..

AB  - Not only Covid-19 has spread all over the world-the policies responding to thispandemic have also diffused rapidly across countries. In this research note, wepresent findings from an original dataset that features mobility restrictions in all EU/EFTA states as well as the United Kingdom during the first wave of thepandemic. We find that most countries adopted restrictions within a few days onlyand that restrictions on internal mobility had been introduced prior torestrictions on cross-border mobility, but that the latter have been morepersistent. Furthermore, we observe an evolution from great variation of policychoices at the outset of the pandemic towards convergence. Analyzing the mobilityrestrictions through a policy diffusion lens, we find tentative evidence forinterdependent policy-making especially in the temporal patterns of adoption. Ourresearch note can serve a basis for future research on policy-making and policydiffusion in times of crisis.

PG  - 297-310
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12461 [doi]
AB  - With the arrival of vaccines against the novel coronavirus in late 2020, theissue of how vaccines should be distributed and which groups should beprioritized has become salient. We study popular attitudes toward thedistribution of COVID-19 vaccines and how these have changed over the course ofthe pandemic in Switzerland, drawing on data from two rounds of an originalpublic opinion survey conducted in the spring and winter of 2020. We find thatthe public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups such as health care workers orthe elderly. We also find a notable degree of cross-generational solidarity:younger age cohorts prioritize the elderly, while older groups prioritize(typically younger) health care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older agegroups, whose solidarity thus seems to be genuine. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue among younger groups, however.

PG  - 243-256
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12458 [doi]
AB  - We study the role of social media in debates regarding two policy responses toCOVID-19 in Switzerland: face-mask rules and contact-tracing apps. We use adictionary classifier to categorize 612'177 tweets by parties, politicians, andthe public as well as 441'458 articles published in 76 newspapers betweenFebruary and August 2020. We distinguish between "problem" (COVID-19) and"solutions" (face masks and contact-tracing apps) and, using a vectorautoregression approach, we analyze the relationship between their salience onsocial and traditional media, as well as among different groups on social media. We find that overall attention to COVID-19 was not driven by endogenous dynamics between the different actors. By contrast, the debate on face masks was led bythe attentive public and by politicians, whereas parties and newspapers followed.The results illustrate how social media challenge the capacity of party and mediaelites to craft a consensus regarding the appropriateness of different measuresas responses to a major crisis.

PG  - 271-282
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12465 [doi]
AB  - International organizations such as the WHO have worked to raise awareness of themassive infodemic that accompanied the COVID-19 outbreak and made it hard forpeople to find trustworthy sources of information and reliable guidance for theirdecisions. Our contribution focuses on the Italian case, where the CommunicationsRegulatory Authority (AGCOM) was able to act as first mover in its field so as tostrategically frame the problem of disinformation in the absence of apre-existing policy intervention. An emerging body of research shows that theactivity of formally independent regulators is not necessarily limited to theimplementation of delegated regulatory competencies. We discuss the implications of the activity of independent regulators for the fight against disinformationduring the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that as a political actor in its own right,the Italian media regulator claimed control over sectoral expertise in order toshape the crucial first steps of the response to the infodemic.

TI  - Civic and Political Engagement during the Multifaceted COVID-19 Crisis.
PG  - 311-324
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12446 [doi]
AB  - Measures to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic have put a sudden halt to streetprotests and other forms of citizen involvement in Europe. At the same time, the pandemic has increased the need for solidarity, motivating citizens to becomeinvolved on behalf of people at risk and the vulnerable more generally. Thisresearch note empirically examines the tension between the demobilisation andactivation potential of the COVID-19 crisis. Drawing on original survey data fromseven Western European countries, we examine the extent, forms, and drivers ofcitizens' engagement. Our findings show the remarkable persistence ofpre-existing political and civic engagement patterns. Concurrently, we show that threat perceptions triggered by the multifaceted COVID-19 crisis have mobilizedEuropeans in the early phase of the pandemic. Similarly, the role of extremeideological orientations in explaining (regular) political engagement indicatesthat the current situation may create its specific mobilisation potentials.

TI  - Refugees and Covid-19: Beyond Health Risks to Insecurity.
PG  - 353-368
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12466 [doi]
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic severely threatens refugees: Most refugees live indeveloping countries with poor health care systems, the lockdowns left manyrefugees without income, border closures prevented forced migrants from theirright to seek asylum and anti-refugee sentiment as well as insecurity in refugee settlements increased. Building on past refugee research and reports onrefugee-related challenges during the Covid-19 crisis, we explain how badsanitation, inadequate accommodation, additional restrictions of movement andemployment and language barriers increase grievances among refugees and tensions between refugees and host populations. Particularly in large and overcrowdedsettlements these issues can lead to violent conflict, as we demonstrate with acase study of the Moria refugee camp in Greece. Yet, the impact of Covid-19 onrefugees generally lacks politicization, and many governments are reluctant orunable to provide adequate housing and sanitation to refugees. We present policy recommendations for improving refugee protection amidst Covid-19, including notonly the prevention of further spread of the virus but also that of insecurity.

TI  - Pandemic and Partisan Polarisation: Voter Evaluation of UK Government HandlingDuring Covid-19.
PG  - 325-338
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12457 [doi]
AB  - What is the effect of pandemics on partisan perceptions of government competence?Taking the case of Covid-19 in the UK, we explore how voters' assessments of the government's handling of the economy and health were affected by four events: thefirst UK Covid-19 death; the national lockdown; Boris Johnson's hospitalisation; and Cummings' scandal. Using a large representative weekly survey in the lastyear totalling over around 30'000 respondents, our results show that Labourvoters had the worst assessments of government handling. The first deathdeteriorated perceptions of government handling of health among both Labour andConservative voters, while Boris Johnson's hospitalisation improved perceptionsamong most voters. Lockdown improved the perception of health handling but at thecost of more negative perceptions of its handling of the economy. The Cummingsscandal had a negative effect on perceptions of government handling of economybut surprisingly improved perceptions of its handling of health.

TI  - Explaining Conspiracy Beliefs and Scepticism around the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 229-242
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12467 [doi]
AB  - Public opinion on COVID-19 provides new empirical evidence for the debate on the ideological contours of conspiracy theories. I report findings from a web survey in Greece where participants were recruited via paid advertising on Facebook and the study sample was adjusted for age, gender, education, domicile, and region ofresidence using a nationally representative reference sample. I find that beliefsabout conspiracy theories are more correlated than the values associated withestablished political ideologies, and that conspiracy beliefs and scepticismabout the pandemic are best explained by belief in unrelated political andmedical conspiracy theories. No other demographic or attitudinal variable hassuch a strong influence, and the results are robust to different statisticalspecifications. In comparison, the effect of ideology measured by left-rightself-placement is rather negligible and further moderated by trust in government.The results have implications for the strategies aimed at fighting disinformationduring public health emergencies.

TI  - The Emotional Foundations of Political Support: How Fear and Anger Affect Trustin the Government in Times of the Covid-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 339-352
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12462 [doi]
AB  - Crises like the current coronavirus pandemic evoke negative emotions in thegeneral public. To date, however, little research has been conducted on theinfluence of these mental states on trust in the government - the uncontested keyplayer in times of crises. Drawing on the appraisal and affective intelligencetheories of emotions, we argue that fear and anger as the two crucial negativeemotions in times of crises have divergent effects on trust in the government:Whereas fear leads to a rally-'round-the-flag effect increasing trust in thegovernment, anger attributes blame for the adverse circumstances to thegovernment. We present empirical evidence for our arguments with an originalthree-wave online panel survey of 1'600 Swiss residents during the unprecedented times of the coronavirus pandemic. Our analysis provides empirical support forour arguments and further shows that the relationship is strongest for right-wingrespondents.

TI  - Sustained decline in tobacco purchasing in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1038/s43856-022-00160-1 [doi]
AB  - Background: An estimated 8 million people die every year due to tobacco use. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the health consequences of smoking, which is aleading risk factor for more severe COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization, anddeath. The pandemic has also led to reductions in physical activity, increases instress and declines in mental well-being, all factors commonly associated withtriggering higher tobacco use. Methods: Using a longitudinal data set ofpurchasing behavior from 2019-2020 among a national sample of the Danishpopulation (n = 4042), we estimate changes in tobacco use during the COVID-19pandemic. Our analysis compares tobacco purchases prior to the pandemic topurchases during the pandemic, at the individual level. We also examine effectswithin subgroups based on smoking behavior in 2019 prior to the pandemic. Weestimate effects for smokers and non-smokers and, within smokers, for occasional smokers and regular smokers. Results: We find large, sustained decreases intobacco purchases during COVID-19. We estimate that weekly tobacco purchase ratesdecline by 24% and average quantities decline by 12% during the period spanningthe onset of the pandemic in March 2020 through the end of the year. The declinesare driven by regular smokers with little change in behavior among nonsmokers andincreases in purchases among occasional smokers. Among regular smokers, purchase rates decline by about 30%, tobacco purchases decline by about 20% and quittingrates increase by about 10 percentage points. Conclusions: Our results suggestthat the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to sustained reductions in smoking.
