AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the impact of occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2positive patients and SARS-CoV-2 positive coworkers, by comparing the frequencyof occupational exposure incidents and the rate of healthcare personnel (HCP) whodeveloped a positive PCR test for SARS-COV-2 after occupational exposure to thetwo different types of infectious individuals. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all confirmed higher risk occupational exposure incidents that occurred in HCPfrom 20 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 at a large multisite US academic medicalcentre. Comparisons between groups for source type were performed using unpaired Student's t-test for continuous variables and the chi(2) test for categoricalvariables, regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations betweensource type and risk of positive COVID-19 test after occupational exposure.RESULTS: In total, 2253 confirmed medium or high-risk occupational exposuresoccurred during the study period. 57% were exposures from coworker sources. Each source individual exposed a mean of 2.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.9) HCP; duringpostexposure surveillance, 4.5% of exposed HCP tested positive within 14 days. A coworker source on average exposed 2.2 (95% CI 2.01 to 2.4) other HCP andinfected 0.14 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.17) HCP, while patient sources exposed a mean of3.4 (95% CI 2.6 to 4.2) HCP but only infected 0.07 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.11) HCP. Themultivariate analysis demonstrated that exposure to a coworker source carried ahigher risk of testing positive compared with exposure to a patient source (OR3.22; 95% CI 1.72 to 6.04). CONCLUSION: Occupational exposures to coworkersources were not only more frequent but also associated with triple the risk ofdeveloping COVID-19 infection, compared with exposures to patient sources.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, characterised byrespiratory, physical and psychological dysfunctions. Rehabilitation couldeffectively alleviate the symptoms and promote recovery of the physical andmental health of patients with COVID-19. Recently, rehabilitation medicalinstitutions have issued clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and expert consensusstatements involving recommendations for rehabilitation assessments andrehabilitation therapies for COVID-19. This systematic review aims to assess the methodological quality and reporting quality of the guidance documents, evaluate the heterogeneity of the recommendations and summarise the recommendations withrespect to rehabilitation assessments and rehabilitation therapies for COVID-19to provide a quick reference for front-line clinicians, therapists and patientsas well as reasonable suggestions for future guidelines. METHODS AND ANALYSIS:The electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), WanfangDatabase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and websites ofgovernments or organisations (eg, National Guideline Clearinghouse, GuidelinesInternational Network, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and WHO) will be searched foreligible CPGs and expert consensus statements from inception to August 2022. CPGsand expert consensus statements published in Chinese or English and presentingrecommendations for modern functional rehabilitation techniques and/ortraditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation techniques for COVID-19 will beincluded. Reviews, interpretations, old versions of CPGs and expert consensusstatements and those for the management of other diseases during the pandemicwill be excluded. Two reviewers will independently review each article, extractdata, appraise the methodological quality following the Appraisal of Guidelinesfor Research & Evaluation II tool and assess the reporting quality with theReporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare statement. The Measurement Scale of Rate of Agreement will be used to evaluate the heterogeneity of therecommendations in different CPGs and expert consensus statements. Agreementbetween reviewers will be calculated using the intraclass correlationcoefficient. We will also summarise the recommendations for rehabilitation inpatients with COVID-19. The results will be narratively described and presentedas tables or figures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not needed forthis systematic review because information from published documents will be used.The findings will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal andreported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020190761.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic and vitamin D: rising trends in status and in daily amounts of vitamin D provided by supplements.
PG  - e059477
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059477 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there have beenplausible suggestions about the need to augment vitamin D intake bysupplementation in order to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection and reduce mortality.Some groups have advocated supplementation for all adults, but governmentalagencies have advocated targeted supplementation. We sought to explore the effectof the COVID-19 pandemic on both vitamin D status and on the dose ofnew-to-market vitamin D supplements. SETTING: University hospital, Dublin,Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory-based samples of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) (n=100 505). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes: comparing yearly average 25OHD prior to the pandemic (April 2019 to March 2020)with during the pandemic (April 2020 to March 2021) and comparing the dose ofnew-to-market vitamin D supplements between 2017 and 2021 (n=2689). SECONDARYOUTCOME: comparing prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D excess duringthe two time periods. RESULTS: The average yearly serum 25OHD measurementincreased by 2.8 nmol/L (61.4, 95% CI 61.5 to 61.7 vs 58.6, 95% CI 58.4 to 58.9, p<0.001), which was almost threefold higher than two similar trend analyses that we conducted between 1993 and 2016. There was a lower prevalence of low 25OHD anda higher prevalence of high 25OHD. The dose of new-to-market vitamin Dsupplements was higher in the years 2020-2021 compared with the years 2017-2019(p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We showed significant increases in serum 25OHD and in thedose of new-to-market vitamin D supplements. The frequency of low vitamin Dstatus reduced indicating benefit, but the frequency of vitamin D excessincreased indicating risk of harm. Rather than a blanket recommendation aboutvitamin D supplementation for all adults, we recommend a targeted approach ofsupplementation within current governmental guidelines to at-risk groups andcautioning consumers about adverse effects of high dose supplements on themarket.

AB  - Many ethical issues were raised by the pandemic crisis. Caregivers were undergreat pressure and stress in their work in residential care facilities for thedependent elderly (Ehpad), both with residents and their families. Theimplementation of ethical support tools was only gradual, particularly for themanagement of residents' deaths. Anxiety has set in among all the people working or living in the Ehpad, blurring interpersonal relations and increasing tensions and professional exhaustion.

AB  - In 2016, sepsis was newly defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused bya dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis remains one of the crucialmedical problems to be solved worldwide. Although the world health organizationhas made sepsis a global health priority, there remain no specific and effective therapy for sepsis so far. Indeed, over the previous decades almost all attempts to develop novel drugs have failed. This may be partly ascribable to themultifactorial complexity of the septic cascade and the resultant difficulties ofidentifying drug targets. In addition, there might still be missing links amongdysregulated host responses in vital organs. In this review article, recentadvances in understanding of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis aresummarized, with a focus on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), thesignificant role of NETs in thrombosis/embolism, and the functional roles ofplasma proteins, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and inter-alpha-inhibitorproteins (IAIPs). The specific plasma proteins that are markedly decreased in theacute phase of sepsis may play important roles in the regulation of blood cells, vascular endothelial cells and coagulation. The accumulating evidence may provideus with insights into a novel aspect of the pathophysiology of sepsis and septic ARDS, including that in COVID-19.

AB  - The prognosis of patients with severe cases of COVID-19 is poor; thus, biomarkersfor earlier prediction of COVID-19 progression are vital. We measured levels offive lung injury-related biomarkers, SP-D, KL-6, presepsin, kallistatin andstratifin, in serum samples collected serially during hospitalization from 31patients with mild/moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia, and theirpredictive performances were compared. Like the previously reported presepsin, a new biomarker candidate, stratifin, was significantly elevated with the onset of severe or critical symptoms in COVID-19 patients and decreased with symptomimprovement. Notably, changes in stratifin and presepsin levels were distinctlyearlier than those in SP-D, KL-6 and even SpO2/FiO2 values. Furthermore, serumlevels of these biomarkers were significantly higher at the pre-severe stage(before the start of oxygen support) of patients who eventually advanced tosevere/critical stages than in the patients who remained at the mild/moderatestage. These results were confirmed in an independent cohort, including 71mild/moderate and 14 severe/critical patients, for whom the performance ofstratifin and presepsin in discriminating between mild/moderate and pre-severeconditions of COVID-19 patients was superior to that of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio.Therefore, we concluded that stratifin and presepsin could be used as prognostic biomarkers for severe COVID-19 progression.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 on the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) during the early pandemic remains unclear. COVID-19 has become one of the leading causes of global mortality, with a disproportionate impact on persons with CVD. Studies of health facility admissions for CVD found significant decreases during thepandemic. Studies of hospital mortality for CVD were more variable. Studies ofpopulation-level CVD mortality differed across countries, with most showingdecreases, although some revealed increases in deaths. In some countries wherelarge increases in CVD deaths were reported in vital registration systems,misclassification of COVID-19 as CVD may have occurred. Taken together, studiessuggest heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on CVD without largeincreases in CVD mortality in 2020 for a number of countries. Clinical andpopulation science research is needed to examine the ways in which the pandemichas affected CVD burden.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic placed significant global pressure on public health, withthe demand for specialist clinical input, equipment and therapeutics oftenoutweighing supply in many well-established healthcare systems. The UK was noexception to this burden, resulting in unprecedented demands being placed on its NHS. Throughout the pandemic, the UK Defence Medical Services (DMS) aided thecivilian healthcare sector, while concurrently adapting as an organisation tomeet its enduring commitment in promoting the operational output of the wider UK Armed Forces. This paper serves to provide an overview of some of these keyactivities while offering proposed lessons which can be learnt, in order topromote the DMS' output in times of future crises. Of note, the DMS aided tomitigate surge demands placed on the NHS' supply chain, assisting in promotingits resilience to provide key materials to civilian clinical personnel.Adaptation of military policy generation mechanisms, together with adoption ofnovel technological approaches to promote remote working, empowered efficient DMSoperational output throughout the pandemic. Direct provision of personnel toassist in the NHS' clinical output served to foster mutually beneficialinterorganisational relationships, while providing objective benefit for the UKpublic.This paper was selected as the BMJ Military Health Royal Society ofMedicine Colt Foundation National Essay Prize Winner 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Starfield describes importance of system-level components of primary care (first-contact, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated), on countries'health systems. We postulate at the individual-level, interpersonal interactions and relationship-centred care are central to primary care. AIM: Explore impact ofCOVID-19 on disruption to doctor-patient relationship and subsequent development of new models of care. DESIGN & SETTING: Series of 11 cross-sectional 'surveys ofNew Zealand urban and rural primary care doctors, nurses and managers, May 2020to February 2021, to understand and monitor responses to pandemic. METHOD: Using inductive content analysis, cumulated qualitative data from doctors was examined through the lenses of doctor-patient relationship, its disruption and resultingchanges in models of care. RESULTS: 1519 responses representing 482 uniqueparticipants, 86% doctors. Four key themes of move to transactionalconsultations; task shifting with team changes; creating a production line; anddiminished communication and coordination across services emerged. CONCLUSION:Advent of pandemic led to severe and ongoing strain on practices requiring rapid change to model of care. Team members took on new roles for triaging, testing andseparating respiratory from non-respiratory patients. Rapid move to telehealth,with policies developed on where face-to-face consultations necessary. Practicestrain exacerbated by disruption to coordination with secondary and otherreferral services. As new models of general practice develop, further disruptionsto development of doctor-patients relationships must be avoided. This workextends Starfield's system-level paradigm to the individual level with the corevalue of primary care the doctor-patient relationship. Successful sustainablemodels likely to be where relationships are centralised.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-small-cell lung cancer pathologic stageand presentation.
PG  - E496-E503
LID - 10.1503/cjs.016721 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is believed that the cessation of normative cancer care servicesduring the COVID-19 pandemic may be resulting in pathologic upstaging and higher long-term mortality rates. We aimed to understand how the pandemic has affectedour patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Weconducted a single-centre retrospective analysis to assess how the COVID-19pandemic has affected patient referrals, pathologic stage of NSCLC, mortalityrates and surgical procedures at our cancer care centre in Ontario, Canada. Atour centre, physicians advocated for and followed recommendations that operationsin cancer patients should be among the last procedures to be delayed. Patientswere included if they were aged 18 years or older, were not receiving palliative care, and had been screened, diagnosed and treated for NSCLC (primary tumours).We compared outcomes between a prepandemic period (January 2019 to February 2020)and a period during the pandemic (March 2020 to February 2021). RESULTS: A total of 695 patients were included for statistical analysis, of whom 650 underwentsurgery. There was no statistically significant difference in any of the outcomesof interest between patients seen before (n = 330) and during (n = 320) thepandemic. CONCLUSION: Cancer care services at our centre were maintained duringthe COVID-19 pandemic, and potential adverse effects on prognosis and survivalthat have been seen in other countries were avoided. The results inform healthcare providers how the effects of future pandemics can be blunted by usingproactive preservative strategies and surgeon advocacy.

AB  - Human milk is important for antimicrobial defense in infants and has welldemonstrated antiviral activity. We evaluated the protective ability of humanmilk against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection in a human fetal intestinal cell culture model. We found that, in this model, human milk blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication, irrespective of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies. Complete inhibition of both envelopedMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human respiratory syncytialvirus infections was also observed, whereas no inhibition of non-envelopedenterovirus A71 infection was seen. Transcriptome analysis after 24 h of theintestinal monolayers treated with human milk showed large transcriptomic changesfrom human milk treatment, and subsequent analysis suggested that ATP1A1down-regulation by milk might be of importance. Inhibition of ATP1A1 blockedSARS-CoV-2 infection in our intestinal model, whereas no effect on EV-A71infection was seen. Our data indicate that human milk has potent antiviralactivity against particular (enveloped) viruses by potentially blocking theATP1A1-mediated endocytic process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to understand the socioeconomic and physicalactivity impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children living with perinatallyacquired HIV (PHIV) and without HIV (HIV-) in Kampala (Uganda). METHODS: Theauthors included children aged 10-18 years who filled out questionnaires atbaseline (2017-2018, prepandemic) and 2 years later (March 2020-January 2021,pandemic) in an observational cohort study at Joint Clinical Research Centre(Kampala). Physical activity energy expenditure was calculated using a youthcompendium from the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research.Descriptive and standard test statistics including Kruskal-Wallis were used.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight children from Kampala Uganda were included prepandemic (101 PHIV and 97 HIV-); 131 (71 PHIV and 60 HIV-) had informationcollected during the pandemic. At baseline, median and interquartile range agewas 13 years (11; 15), and 52% were females. During the pandemic, overall weekly physical activity increased by a median of 854 minutes (interquartile range:270-1890), and energy expenditures increased by 16% in both PHIV and in HIV- (P <.001 for groups overall prepandemic vs pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: The authors found in this Ugandan cohort of children that children engaged in more physicalactivity. Further research is warranted to understand the long-term effects ofthe pandemic on children's well-being.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The anxiety disorders are the most prevalentmental health condition, and anxiety is considered the sixth cause of disability surpassing diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, andosteoarthritis. Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an increase in the numberof psychiatric diseases diagnosis in all social layers around the world. About55%-94% of patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders are treated withbenzodiazepines, meanwhile benzodiazepines can promote several adverse effects.In this way, alternative therapies, such as essential oils may offer significant benefits in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. However, theanxiolytic effect of these essential oils must be proper evaluated appropriate aswell as the suitable dosage and side effect need further research. AIM OF THESTUDY: The aim was to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of Roman chamomile (Anthemisnobilis L.) and tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco) essential oils using thelight-dark test in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bothessential oils were analyzed by GC-MS and the major compounds were identified.The anxiolytic effect was evaluated by light-dark test in adult zebrafish.RESULTS: The results showed that roman chamomile essential oil has anxiolyticeffect in adult zebrafish, whereas tangerine essential oil tends to reduceanxiety The major compounds of tangerine essential oil were limonene andgamma-terpinene, and the major compounds of roman chamomile werepentadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, hexadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, 1-piperidinoland trans-1-ethyl-3-methyl-cyclopentane. CONCLUSIONS: The present studydemonstrated that this anxiolytic effect may be attributed to the synergisticeffect of the compounds present in roman chamomile essential oil, particularlythe major compounds. The roman chamomile essential oil at the highestconcentration showed anxiolytic effect. The tangerine essential oil showed atendency to reduce anxiety, but it was not statistically significative. Inaddition, roman chamomile and tangerine essential oils did not cause causealteration in locomotion activity and exploratory ability of the fish.

AB  - The 2021 Annual Safety Pharmacology (SP) Society (SPS) meeting was held virtuallyOctober 4-8, 2021 due to the continuing COVID-19 global pandemic. This themedissue of J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods comprises articles arising from the meeting.As in previous years the manuscripts reflect various areas of innovation in SPincluding a perspective on aging and its impact on drug attrition during safetyassessments, an integrated assessment of respiratory, cardiovascular and animalactivity of in vivo nonclinical studies, development of a dynamic QT-ratecorrection method in primates, evaluation of the "comprehensive in vitroproarrhythmia assay" (CiPA) ion channel protocol to the automated patch clamp,and best practices regarding the conduct of hERG electrophysiology studies and ananalysis of secondary pharmacology assays by the FDA. The meeting also generated 85 abstracts (reproduced in the current volume of J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods).It appears that the validation of methods remains a challenge in SP.Nevertheless, the continued efforts to mine approaches to detection ofproarrhythmia liability remains a baffling obsession given the ability ofIndustry to completely prevent drugs entering into clinical study only to befound to have proarrhythmic properties, with no reports of such for at least ten years. Perhaps it is time to move on from CiPA and find genuine problems tosolve?

AB  - Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which are pivotalsensors of RNA virus invasions, mediate the transcriptional induction of genesencoding type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, successfullyestablishing host antiviral immune response. A few excellent reviews haveelaborated on the structural biology of RLRs and the antiviral mechanisms of RLR activation. In this review, we give a basic understanding of RLR biology andsummarize recent findings of how RLR signaling cascade is strictly controlled by host regulatory mechanisms, which include RLR-interacting proteins,post-translational modifications and microRNAs (miRNAs). Furthermore, we payparticular attention to the relationship between RLRs and diseases, especiallyhow RLRs participate in SARS-CoV-2, malaria or bacterial infections, howsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or mutations in RLRs and antibodiesagainst RLRs lead to autoinflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases, and howRLRs are involved in anti-tumor immunity. These findings will provide insightsand guidance for antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies targeting RLRs.

AB  - Viral infectious diseases have various neurological manifestations, whether they are epidemic or pandemic in nature. Nonspecific encephalopathy is the most commoncentral nervous system (CNS) manifestation. The spectrum of nervous evidencevaries for viral pathogens. Some infectious viruses, such as the Ebola virus,exhibit direct neurotropism. Others, such as the Rift Valley fever virus, havethe potential for neurotropism. Direct neurotropism is unknown in monkeypoxvirus, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and even smallpox. As seen in the COVID-19, theremay be evidence of para-infectious neurological syndrome. There have only been a few reports of neurological diseases caused by monkeypox infection. Futureefforts to prevent the spread of infectious disease surges can reduce mortalitycomplications, the therapeutic burden on the health-care system, and preventfurther spread. This study describes the clinical and neurological complications of monkeypox infection, particularly encephalitis, as well as the laboratorydiagnosis of these cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Immunocompromised patients have an increased risk of severe form ofCOVID-19. The clinical efficacy of the tixagevimab/cilgavimab monoclonal antibodycombination as pre-exposure prophylaxis against BA.1 and BA.2 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages is unknown. We aimed to describe the incidence and outcomes ofCOVID-19 among immunocompromised patients receiving tixagevimab/cilgavimab aspreexposure prophylaxis, during the Omicron wave in France. METHODS: This is anobservational multicentre cohort study of immunocompromised patients receivingtixagevimab/cilgavimab as preexposure prophylaxis between December 28(th), 2021, and March 31(st), 2022. Patients received tixagevimab/cilgavimab 150/150 mgintramuscularly if they had impaired vaccine response, and a high risk of severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Tixagevimab/cilgavimab was administered to 1112immunocompromised patients. After a median [range] follow-up of 63 [49-73] days, COVID-19 was confirmed in 49/1112 (4.4%) at least 5 days following treatment.During the study period, mean weekly incidence rate was 1669 in 100,000inhabitants in Ile-de-France and 530 in 100,000 among patients who receivedtixagevimab/cilgavimab prophylaxis. Among infected patients, 43/49 (88%) had amild-to moderate form and 6/49 (12%) had a moderate-to-severe form of COVID-19.Patients with moderate-to-severe illnesses were less likely to have receivedearly therapies than patients with mild forms (53.5% vs. 16.7% respectively) and 2/49 (4%) patients died from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a low rate of infections and severe illnesses among immunocompromised patients treated with tixagevimab/cilgavimab. A global preventive strategy including vaccines,preexposure prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies, and early therapies might be effective to prevent severe forms of COVID-19 among severely immunocompromisedpatients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the worldwide impact of a virtual Neurosurgery-NeuroscienceLecture Series on optimizing neurosurgical education with tele-teaching. METHODS:A retrospective analysis was performed from our Zoom database to collect datafrom October 15, 2020, to December 14, 2020, and from September 27, 2021, toDecember 13, 2021. A comparative analysis of participants in the two differenttimeframes was performed to investigate the impact of tele-teaching onneurosurgical education worldwide. To evaluate participant satisfaction, theyearly Continuing Medical Education reports of 2020-2021 were analyzed. Datarelated to the distribution of lectures by subspecialties were also described.RESULTS: Among the 11 lectures of the first period, a total of 257 participantsfrom 17 countries in 4 different continents were recorded, with a mean of 64(SD=9,30) participants for each meeting; 342 attendees participated from 19countries in 5 continents over the 11 lectures of the second part, with anaverage of 82,8 (SD=14,04) attendees.; a statistically significant increase inparticipation between the two periods was identified (p<0.001) A total of 19(2020) and 21 (2021) participants submitted the Continuing Medical Educationyearly survey. More than 86,4% of overall responses considered the lectures"excellent. Main topics reported during lectures in 2020-2021 were related tobrain tumors (33,7%) and education (22,1%). CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemichas increased the need to introduce new educational approaches for teaching novelways to optimize patient care. Our multidisciplinary web-based virtual lectureseries could represent an innovative tele-teaching platform in neurosurgicaltraining.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the function of patients with COVID-19 admitted to anacute care hospital early in the pandemic and to characterize change in function among those admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and to non-critical careservices. DESIGN: This descriptive, retrospective cohort study examined patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a tertiary care medical center during thefirst wave of the pandemic in 2020. Included patients were stratified into fourcohorts based on whether or not they received therapy during theirhospitalization and whether or not their hospitalization included time in theintensive care unit (ICU). Data on demographics, functional impairments, medical interventions, and functional outcomes were collected. SETTING: HospitalPARTICIPANTS: : 432 adult patients were included in this study. RESULTS: ICUpatients receiving therapy were more likely to have impaired cognition, impaired strength, and impaired sensation than non-ICU patients receiving therapy.Patients made improvements from evaluation to discharge on the Functional Status Score for the ICU, AM-PAC Daily Activity, and AM-PAC Basic Mobility Short Forms. CONCLUSION: Patients admitted with COVID-19 experienced significant functionalimpairments, but also demonstrated improvement during the course of theirhospitalizations. This study can facilitate healthcare provider awareness of the detrimental functional impacts of COVID-19 and the potential role ofrehabilitation services for these patients.

AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but 3 of 4 USadults do not have their blood pressure adequately controlled. Million Hearts (USDepartment of Health and Human Services) is a national initiative that promotes aset of priorities and interventions to optimize delivery of evidence-basedstrategies to manage cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. The COVID-19pandemic, however, has disrupted routine care and preventive service delivery. Weidentified examples of clinical and health organizations that adapted servicesand care processes to continue a focus on monitoring and controlling hypertensionduring the pandemic. Eight Hypertension Control Exemplars were identified andinterviewed. They reported various adapted care strategies includingtelemedicine, engaging patients in self-measured blood pressure monitoring,adapting or implementing medication management services, activating partnerships to respond to patient needs or expand services, and implementing unique patientoutreach approaches. Documenting these hypertension control strategies can helpincrease adoption of adaptive approaches during public health emergencies androutine care.

TI  - Impact of the COVID 19 Pandemic on Treatment of nAMD via a Portal-BasedCollaboration.
LID - 10.1055/a-1806-2474 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Under the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic and the lockdown inGermany, there were significantly fewer consultations in almost all medicaldisciplines. Especially given the need for consistent treatment and follow-up of nAMD patients, this can have far-reaching consequences for visual function,especially in elderly patients. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of nAMDpatients, the number of visits (IVI or follow-up), OCTs or IVIs performed and themean worst visual acuity for the period before and after the first COVID19-associated lockdown were compared in a portal-based collaboration of 50 eyecare practices. Patients were treated according to the pro re nata (PRN) regimen that included intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors based on activitycriteria in the OCT follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 34,660 visits from 55 monthswere included in the analysis. Before lockdown (16 March 2020), an average of81.8% +/- 2.1% of patients were regularly checked or treated (every 4 to 5weeks). With the onset of lockdown, the proportion of patients receiving optimum treatment dropped to 64.0%. Initially, the proportion of OCT follow-ups decreasedfrom 48.4% to 30.9% and, with a delay, the proportion of injections decreasedfrom 57.5% to 45.8%. This was also reflected in the number of OCT follow-ups:15.5 before, 11.4 during and 17.2 after lockdown (p < 0.001). In 29% of cases, anindividual worsening of visual acuity by more than 0.1 logMAR after the end ofthe lockdown compared to before the lockdown could be observed. On average, mean visual acuity decreased significantly by 0.054 logMAR (p < 10(-11)). Thissignificant impairment was not reversed again during the remaining observationperiod, although the number of visits, OCT examinations and IVIs in the following12 months were at the pre-lockdown level. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic-relatedlockdown resulted in unintended treatment breaks in nAMD patients receiving IVItherapy. The decrease in visits as well as in IVIs caused a loss of visualfunction in the observed cohort. The consistent treatment regimen of nAMDpatients was resumed shortly after the lockdown with an immediate normalizationof the number of OCT examinations and IVIs. However, a permanent loss of visualfunction was observed, and this did not improve within a year after the lockdown.This finding highlights the importance of better case management, leading toimproved patient adherence in the event of further waves of COVID or otherpandemics.

TI  - Discovery and Mechanistic Study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PafA Inhibitors.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00289 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and isranked as the second killer infectious disease after COVID-19. Proteasomeaccessory factor A (PafA) is considered an attractive target because of its lowsequence conservation in humans and its role in virulence. In this study, wedesigned a mutant of Mtb PafA that enabled large-scale purification of activePafA. Using a devised high-throughput screening assay, two PafA inhibitors werediscovered. ST1926 inhibited Mtb PafA by binding in the Pup binding groove, butit was less active against Corynebacterium glutamicum PafA because theST1926-binding residues are not conserved. Bithionol bound to the conservedATP-binding pocket, thereby, inhibits PafA in an ATP-competitive manner. BothST1926 and bithionol inhibited the growth of an attenuated Mtb strain (H37Ra) at micromolar concentrations. Our work thus provides new tools for tuberculosisresearch and a foundation for future PafA-targeted drug development for treating tuberculosis.

AB  - Heterologous vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides arational strategy to rapidly increase vaccination coverage in many regions of theworld. Although data regarding messenger RNA (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 vaccinecombinations are available, there is limited information about the combination ofthese platforms with other vaccines widely used in developing countries, such as BBIBP-CorV and Sputnik V. Here, we assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicityof 15 vaccine combinations in 1,314 participants. We evaluate immunoglobulin G(IgG) anti-spike response and virus neutralizing titers and observe that a numberof heterologous vaccine combinations are equivalent or superior to homologousschemes. For all cohorts in this study, the highest antibody response is induced by mRNA-1273 as the second dose. No serious adverse events are detected in any ofthe schedules analyzed. Our observations provide rational support for the use of different vaccine combinations to achieve wide vaccine coverage in the shortestpossible time.

AB  - Recent biochemical, biophysical, and genetic studies have shown that heparansulfate, a major component of the cellular glycocalyx, participates in infection of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating the so-called open conformation of the spikeprotein, which is required for binding to ACE2. This review highlights theinvolvement of heparan sulfate in the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle and argues that there is a high degree of coordination between host cell heparan sulfate andasparagine-linked glycans on the spike in enabling ACE2 binding and subsequentinfection. The discovery that spike protein binding and infection depends on bothviral and host glycans provides insights into the evolution, spread and potentialtherapies for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic created major challenges across society,healthcare provision and also for those delivering healthcare educationprogrammes. Clinical placements were disrupted and, in many incidences cancelled.Higher education institutions were required to move completely to online deliverymethods with little notice. This created significant additional workload, stress and the need to learn new skills at a time of great uncertainty. This studyexplored the risks of burnout in academic radiographers during the first 12months of the pandemic. METHODS: A survey was circulated using SurveyMonkey viapersonal, national and international networks, including the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS), to reach as many academic radiographers aspossible. Disengagement and exhaustion were measured using the Oldenburg burnout inventory. Descriptive statistics and a one-way ANOVA were used to analyse thequantitative data using STATA V16 (Statacorp, TA). RESULTS: 533 academicradiographers responded to the survey from 43 different countries. Meandisengagement was in the medium range and exhaustion was high for the totaldataset. In a subset of countries with 10 or more responses, there wassignificant variation between countries, with the UK having highest meanexhaustion score and the UK, Ireland and France sharing the highest meandisengagement score. In the total dataset, 86% agreed workload had increasedduring the pandemic and 35% had considered leaving academia in the last year.CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the stark reality of the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic on academic radiographers' workload, wellbeing, and intentionto leave their roles. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: COVID-19 has had a significantimpact on academic radiographers and this study highlights the urgent need forremedial measures to better support academic radiographers in order to ensure asufficient, and sustainable workforce.

AB  - Based on the growing literature on the link between government policy and mental health, this article proposes a socio-ecological model to understand the wayimmigration policy and law enforcement specifically have become a key determinantof mental health among undocumented immigrants and their families. Based on thelatest research on the subject, the article organizes and defines the spiral thatgoes from the main features of governmental immigration policy and lawenforcement to the stressors they generate among the migrant community and mentalhealth outcomes among different groups within it. It also considers the copingmechanisms migrants adopt to deal with their legal vulnerability, classifyingthem into those which worsen mental health outcomes and some which,paradoxically, make migrant communities resilient.

AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is drawing increasing attention as apromising tool for an early warning of emerging infectious diseases such asCOVID-19. This study demonstrated the utility of a spatial bisection method (SBM)and a global optimization algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm, GA), to supportbetter designing and operating a WBE program for disease surveillance and source identification. The performances of SBM and GA were compared in determining theoptimal locations of sewer monitoring manholes to minimize the difference amongthe effective spatial monitoring scales of the selected manholes. While GA wasmore flexible in determining the spatial resolution of the monitoring areas, SBM allows stepwise selection of optimal sampling manholes with equiarealsubcatchments and lowers computational cost. Upon detecting disease outbreaks at a regular sewer monitoring site, additional manholes within the catchment can be selected and monitored to identify source areas with a required spatialresolution. SBM offered an efficient method for rapidly searching for the optimallocations of additional sampling manholes to identify the source areas. Thisstudy provides strategic and technical elements of WBE including sampling siteselection with required spatial resolution and a source identification method.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica (GCA/PMR) represent independent risk factors for worse outcomes in COVID-19.METHODS: Observational, national, French, multicenter cohort (NCT04353609)comprising patients aged >/=18 years with confirmed diagnoses of either GCA, PMR or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) having presented COVID-19; those under rituximabwere excluded. Primary endpoint was COVID-19 severity in GCA/PMR patients ascompared to RA. We also aimed to describe the evolution of GCA/PMR patientsfollowing COVID-19. Multinomial logistic regression models were performed, withand without adjustment on pre-specified confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, bodymass index, arterial hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease).Unadjusted and adjusted multinomial odds-ratio (OR/aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as effect size using RA as reference group.RESULTS: Between April 15, 2020, and August 20, 2021, 674 patients [45 (6.6%)GCA, 47 (7.0%) PMR, 582 (86.4%) RA; 62.8 years, 73.2% female] were included.Compared to RA patients, those with GCA/PMR were older and more frequentlypresented hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Severe COVID-19 and death occurred in 24 (26.1%) and 16 (17.8%) patients with GCA/PMR, respectively. Unadjusted analyses revealed higher odds of severe COVID-19 [OR = 3.32 (95% CI1.89-5.83; p < 0.001)] and death [OR = 3.20 (95%CI 1.67-6.13; p < 0.001)] forGCA/PMR compared to RA. After model adjustment, these odds were attenuated.CONCLUSION: Patients with GCA/PMR were more likely to have severe COVID-19 andhigher mortality compared to those with RA. This worse prognosis is mostly due towell known risk factors for the general population rather than vasculitis per se.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes ofbarotrauma (pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema) in mechanicallyventilated COVID-19 patients. To describe the chest radiography patterns ofbarotrauma and understand the development in relation to mechanical ventilationand patient mortality. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 363patients with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 8, 2020. Primary outcomes werepneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema with or without pneumothorax,pneumoperitoneum, or pneumoretroperitoneum. The secondary outcomes were length ofintubation and death. In patients with pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneousemphysema, we conducted an imaging review to determine the timeline of barotraumadevelopment. RESULTS: Forty three out of 363 (12%) patients developed barotrauma radiographically. The median time to development of either pneumomediastinum orsubcutaneous emphysema was 2 days (IQR 1.0-4.5) after intubation and the mediantime to pneumothorax was 7 days (IQR 2.0-10.0). The overall incidence ofpneumothorax was 28/363 (8%) with an incidence of 17/43 (40%) in the barotraumacohort and 11/320 (3%) in those without barotrauma (p </= 0.001). In total,257/363 (71%) patients died with an increase in mortality in those withbarotrauma 33/43 (77%) vs. 224/320 (70%). When adjusting for covariates,barotrauma was associated with increased odds of death (OR 2.99, 95% CI1.25-7.17). CONCLUSION: Barotrauma is a frequent complication of mechanicallyventilated COVID-19 patients. In comparison to intubated COVID-19 patientswithout barotrauma, there is a higher rate of pneumothorax and an increased risk of death.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT), prior to the COVID pandemic, was rare representing 0.5 of all strokes, with the diagnosis made by MRI or CTvenography.(1-,3) COVID-19 patients compared to general populations have a 30-60 times greater risk of CVT compared to non-affected populations, and up to a thirdof severe COVID patients may have thrombotic complications.(4-8) Currently,vaccines are the best way to prevent severe COVID-19. In February 2021, reportsof CVT and Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) related toadenovirus viral vector vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine(AZD1222 (ChAdOx1)) and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine (JNJ-78436735(Ad26.COV2.S)), were noted, with a 1/583,000 incidence from Johnson and Johnsonvaccine in the United States.(11, 12) This study retrospectively analyzed CVT andcross-sectional venography at an Eastern Medical Center from 2018 to 2021, andpresents radiographic examples of CVT and what is learned from the immuneresponse. METHODS: After IRB approval, a retrospective review of cross-sectional CTV and MRVs from January 1st 2018 to April 30th 2021, at a single health system was performed. Indications, vaccine status, patient age, sex, and positivefinding incidence were specifically assessed during March and April for eachyear. A multivariable-adjusted trends analysis using Poisson regression estimatedvenogram frequencies and multivariable logistic regression compared sex, age,indications and vaccination status. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2021, (Fig. 1), a total of n = 2206 in patient and emergency roomcross-sectional venograms were obtained, with 322 CTVs and 1884 MRVs. In 2018,2019, 2020, respective totals of cross-sectional venograms were 568, 657, 660,compared to 321 cross-sectional venograms in the first four months of 2021. CTVin 2018, 2019, 2020, respective totals were 51, 86, 97, MRV totals were 517, 571,563, compared to the 2021 first four month totals of 88 CTVs and 233 MRVs. March,April 2018, 2019, 2020, CTVs respectively were 6, 17, 11, compared to the 2021first four months of 59 CTVs, comprising 63% of the total 93 CTVs, respectiveMRVs were 79, 97, 52, compared to 143 MRVs in the first four months of 2021 for39% of the total 371 MRVs. In March, April 2020 during the pandemic onset,cross-sectional imaging at the East Coast Medical Center decreased, as prioritieswere on maintaining patient ventilation, high level of care and limiting spreadof disease. In March/April 2021, reports of VITT and CVT likely contributed toincreased CTVs and MRVs, of 39.65% [1.20-1.63] increase (P < 0.001) from prior.In March, April 2021 of 202 venograms obtained, 158 (78.2.%) were unvaccinatedpatients, 16 positive for CVT (10.1%), 44 were on vaccinated patients (21.7%), 8 specifically ordered with vaccination as a clinical indication, 2 positive forCVT (4.5%), (odds ratio = 0.52 [0.12-2.38], p = 0.200). CONCLUSION: CTV prior to the COVID pandemic, was rare, responsible for 0.5 of all strokes, at the onset ofthe pandemic in the East Coast, overall cross-sectional imaging volumes declined due to maintaining ventilation, high levels of care and limiting disease spread, although COVID-19 patients have a 30-60 times greater risk of CVT compared to thegeneral population, and vaccination is currently the best option to mitigatesevere disease. In early 2021, reports of adenoviral vector COVID vaccinescausing CTV and VITT, led to at 39.65% increase in cross-sectional venography,however, in this study unvaccinated patients in 2021 had higher incidence of CVT (10.1%), compared to the vaccinated patients (4.5%). Clinicians should be awarethat VITT CVT may present with a headache 5-30 days post-vaccination withthrombosis best diagnosed on CTV or MRV. If thrombosis is present withthrombocytopenia, platelets <150 x 10(9), elevated D-Dimer >4000 FEU, andpositive anti-PF4 ELISA assay, the diagnosis is definitive.(13) VITT CVTresembles spontaneous autoimmune heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and ispostulated to occur from platelet factor 4 (PF4) binding to vaccine adenoviralvectors forming a novel antigen, anti-PF4 memory B-cells and anti-PF4 (VITT)antibodies.(14-17).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The relationship that vaccination against corona virus disease 19(COVID-19) or recovery from the acute form of the illness may have with theincidence or severity of acute appendicitis (AA) has not been explored. The aimof this study was to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A single centreretrospective study of all consecutive adult patients presenting with AA in the 6mo after the initiation of a national vaccination program was performed. Thepresenting characteristics and pathological data of patients who had either been vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19 were compared with those who hadnot. In addition, historical data from the equivalent period 12 and 24 mobeforehand was also extracted. The incidence of AA was compared between each ofthese time-frames. RESULTS: Of the 258 patients initially identified, 255 wereincluded in the analysis of which 156 had either been vaccinated and/or recoveredfrom COVID-19 (61.2%) whilst 99 (38.8%) patients had not. When comparing thesetwo groups, there were no significant differences in the presentingcharacteristics, operative findings or postoperative courses. There was also nosignificant change in the incidence of AA when comparing the study dates withhistorical data (median weekly incidence of AA 8.0 versus 8.0 versus 8.0respectively, P = 0.672). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data presented here, wefailed to find a relationship between a national vaccination program and both thenature and incidence of AA presenting to a busy urban hospital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We explore injecting risk and HIV incidence among PWID in New YorkCity (NYC), from 2012 to 2019, when incidence was extremely low, <0.1/100person-years at risk, and during disruption of prevention services due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We developed an Agent-Based model (ABM) to simulatesharing injecting equipment and measure HIV incidence in NYC. The model wasadapted from a previous ABM model developed to compare HIV transmission with"high" versus "low" dead space syringes. Data for applying the model to NYCduring the period of very low HIV incidence was taken from the "Risk Factors"study, a long-running study of participants entering substance use treatment inNYC. Injecting risk behavior had not been eliminated in this population, withapproximately 15 % reported recent syringe sharing. Data for possibletransmission during COVID-19 disruption was taken from previous HIV outbreaks andearly studies of the pandemic in NYC. RESULTS: The modeled incidence rates fellwithin the 95 % confidence bounds of all of the empirically observed incidencerates, without any additional calibration of the model. Potential COVID-19disruptions increased the probability of an outbreak from 0.03 to 0.25.CONCLUSIONS: The primary factors in the very low HIV incidence were the extremelysmall numbers of PWID likely to transmit HIV and that most sharing occurs within small, relatively stable, mostly seroconcordant groups. Containing an HIVoutbreak among PWID during a continuing pandemic would be quite difficult.Pre-pandemic levels of HIV prevention services should be restored as quickly asfeasible.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the thoughts of preschool children andtheir mothers about COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS: This qualitative study wasdescriptive phenomenology design. Data were collected and analyzed throughindividual interviews from 26 people (13 mothers and 13 children) using aPersonal Information Form and an Interview Form.After the thematic analysis, fourmain themes were created for the children and their mothers. RESULTS: The mainthemes created for mothers and children were: "Effects of the COVID-19 pandemicprocess, Protection, Family relations, Perspective of healthcare staff". TheCOVID-19 pandemic has affected the physical, psycho-social, and economic health, spirituality and family relationships of mothers. It became evident that childrenknew the terms related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Children dreamt of activitiesthey missed and stated that at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, they would go tothe park, the pool, shopping centers, to school, and on vacation. Most of themothers and children followed the rules of protection. In addition, mothers andchildren stated that their perspectives on healthcarestaff changed positivelyafter the pandemic started. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that COVID-19 affectsindividuals bio-psycho-socially, it is crucial for health professionals to knowthe thoughts of individuals, families and children about COVID-19 to increasetheir awareness of potential problems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular processes associated with cellular regulatoryprograms in patients with COVID-19, including gene activation or repressionmediated by epigenetic mechanisms. We hypothesized that a comprehensive geneexpression profiling of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells might expand ourunderstanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of severe COVID-19. METHODS: We usedsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) profiling of ciliated cells (n = 12,725)from healthy controls (SARS-CoV-2 negative n = 13) and patients withmild/moderate (n = 13) and severe (n = 14) COVID-19. ScRNAseq data at the patientlevel were used to perform gene set and pathway enrichment analyses. Weprioritized candidate miRNA-target interactions and epigenetic mechanisms.RESULTS: We found that mild/moderate COVID-19 compared to healthy controls hadupregulation of gene expression signatures associated with mitochondrialfunction, misfolded proteins, and membrane permeability. In addition, we foundthat compared to mild/moderate disease, severe COVID-19 had downregulation ofepigenetic mechanisms, including DNA and histone H3K4 methylation and chromatinremodelling regulation. Furthermore, we found 11-ranked miRNAs that may explainmiRNA-dependent regulation of histone methylation, some of which share seedsequences with SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our results may provide novelinsights into the epigenetic mechanisms mediating the clinical course ofSARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - One of the many outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic was a shift in the delivery of elementary (primary) education. Schools transitioned swiftly to e-learning andprioritized education that was already or could be easily adapted to virtualformats. Given the paucity of online content available, it is not likely thatchild sexual abuse (CSA) prevention education was prioritized. Given that CSAprevention education has demonstrated success in increasing knowledge, protectivebehaviors, and disclosures, and the potential long-term need for e-learningoptions, there is a demand for an exploration of how CSA prevention can beimplemented using e-learning strategies. In the current discussion, we explorehow school-based CSA prevention education could be implemented in a "new normal" context of e-learning. We first present the existing e-learning content for CSAprevention education. We then describe how best practices for preventioneducation can be applied to e-learning. Finally, we present considerations forthe use of e-learning specifically for CSA prevention education. In short,implementing CSA prevention programs through e-learning offers many affordancesfor program accessibility and reach, flexibility in implementation andopportunities for greater exposure to content, and a wide range of ways todemonstrate effective skills and engage children in cycles of practice andfeedback. E-learning, may also, however, limit important conversations betweenchildren and trained instructors that lead to disclosures. The extant literature leaves us unsure as to whether implementing CSA prevention programs throughe-learning will result in better or worse outcomes for children. However, giventhe increasing demand for e-learning options, and the promise of some newe-learning programs, further research on the effectiveness of e-learning CSAprevention programs is warranted.

TI  - Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein onPolystyrene Surface.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00562 [doi]
AB  - A prominent feature of coronaviruses is the presence of a large glycoproteinspike (S) protruding from the viral particle. The specific interactions of amaterial with S determine key aspects such as its possible role for indirecttransmission or its suitability as a virucidal material. Here, we considerall-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction between a polymersurface (polystyrene) and S in its up and down conformations. Polystyrene is acommonly used plastic found in electronics, toys, and many other common objects. Also, previous atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments showed substantialadhesion of S over polystyrene, stronger than in other common materials. Ourresults show that the main driving forces for the adsorption of the S proteinover polystyrene were hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions with S amino acids andglycans. The interaction was stronger for the case of S in the up conformation,which exposes one highly flexible receptor binding domain (RBD) that adjusts its conformation to interact with the polymer surface. In this case, the interaction has similar contributions from the RBD and glycans. In the case of S in the down conformation, the interaction with the polystyrene surface was weaker and it was dominated by glycans located near the RBD. We do not find significant structural changes in the conformation of S, a result which is in deep contrast to ourprevious results with another hydrophobic surface (graphite). Our results suggestthat SARS-CoV-2 virions may adsorb strongly over plastic surfaces withoutsignificantly affecting their infectivity.

TI  - Safety of Booster Doses of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine inPregnancy in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004889 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and summarize reports to the Vaccine Adverse EventReporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system, in pregnantpeople who received a booster dose of mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)vaccine. METHODS: We searched VAERS for U.S. reports of adverse events inpregnant people who received a booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine fromSeptember 22, 2021, to March 24, 2022. Clinicians reviewed reports and available medical records. RESULTS: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System received 323reports of adverse events in pregnant people who received a booster dose ofCOVID-19 vaccine; 178 (55.1%) after BNT162b2 from Pfizer-BioNTech and 145 (44.9%)after mRNA-1273 from Moderna. Seventy-two (22.3%) reports were coded as serious. One neonatal death was reported, but no maternal deaths occurred.Pregnancy-specific outcomes included 56 (17.3%) spontaneous abortions (before 20 weeks of gestation), eight (2.5%) episodes of vaginal bleeding, five (1.5%)stillbirths (at or after 20 weeks of gestation), four (1.2%) episodes ofpreeclampsia, and two (0.6%) preterm deliveries. Reporting rates for stillbirthand preterm delivery were below background rates. Ten instances of adverse eventsin neonates were reported, which included two reports of birth defects.Non-pregnancy-specific adverse events (n=207; 64.1%) were mostly systemic (eg,headache, fatigue) and local reactions and occurred in proportions comparablewith those seen in pregnant people who received the primary COVID-19 vaccination series and reported to VAERS during the same period. CONCLUSION: Review ofreports after a booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant people in VAERSfound their safety profile was comparable with that of published reports afterprimary COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant people.

TI  - Pulmonary Surfactant Proteins are Inhibited by IgA Autoantibodies in SevereCOVID-19.
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202201-0011OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to acute respiratorydistress syndrome with fatal outcomes. Evidence suggests that dysregulated immuneresponses, including autoimmunity, are key pathogenic factors. OBJECTIVES: Toassess whether IgA autoantibodies target lung-specific proteins and contribute todisease severity. METHODS: We collected 147 blood, 9 lung tissue, and 36bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from three tertiary hospitals in Switzerlandand one in Germany. Severe COVID-19 was defined by the need to administer oxygen.We investigated the presence of IgA autoantibodies and their effects on pulmonarysurfactant in COVID-19 using the following methods: immunofluorescence on tissue samples, immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry on bronchoalveolarlavage fluid samples, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on blood samples, andsurface tension measurements with medical surfactant. MEASUREMENTS AND MAINRESULTS: IgA autoantibodies targeting pulmonary surfactant proteins B and C were elevated in patients with severe COVID-19, but not in patients with influenza or bacterial pneumonia. Notably, pulmonary surfactant failed to reduce surfacetension after incubation with either plasma or purified IgA from patients withsevere COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with severe COVID-19harbor IgA against pulmonary surfactant proteins B and C and that theseantibodies block the function of lung surfactant, potentially contributing toalveolar collapse and poor oxygenation.

AB  - Intermittently, the concept of herd immunity has been a potent, if sometimesambiguous and controversial, means of framing the global response to the COVID-19pandemic and envisaging its end. Realizing the full meaning of human herdimmunity requires further attention to its connections after World War I withBritish social theory. Distracted by "obvious" yet unsubstantiatedcorrespondences with veterinary research, historians of the concept have notengaged with the more proximate influence of discussions of social psychology andgroup dynamics on postwar epidemiology. Understanding the openness of early 20th century epidemiology to social thought deepens our appreciation of thesignificance of herd or population immunity, as well as suggests new avenues for exchange between public health and contemporary social sciences.

AB  - In response to rapidly changing societal conditions stemming from the COVID-19pandemic, we summarize data sources with potential to produce timely andspatially granular measures of physical, economic, and social conditions relevantto public health surveillance, and we briefly describe emerging analytic methods to improve small-area estimation. To inform this article, we reviewed publishedsystematic review articles set in the United States from 2015 to 2020 andconducted unstructured interviews with senior content experts in public heathpractice, academia, and industry. We identified a modest number of data sourceswith high potential for generating timely and spatially granular measures ofphysical, economic, and social determinants of health. We also summarizedmodeling and machine-learning techniques useful to support development oftime-sensitive surveillance measures that may be critical for responding tofuture major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Supporting Emergent Bilinguals Who Use Augmentative and Alternative Communicationand Their Families: Lessons in Telepractice From the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1044/2022_AJSLP-22-00003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to examine the effect of the COVID-19pandemic on speech-language pathologist (SLP) service provision for emergentbilinguals who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Oneprominent issue in AAC service delivery is the efficacy and feasibility ofproviding AAC services via telepractice. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified thisissue as most providers, clients, and families adjusted to remote servicedelivery models. While emerging evidence supports telepractice in AAC, little is known about the potential benefits and challenges of telepractice for emergentbilinguals who use AAC and their families. METHOD: Data were collected via anationwide survey. Licensed SLPs (N = 160) completed an online questionnaire withLikert-type, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions, analyzed using mixedmethods. RESULTS: Findings illustrated a shift in service delivery from in-personto telepractice and hybrid (both telepractice and in-person) models. Overall,child intervention outcomes declined for emergent bilinguals who used AAC during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of service delivery format. However,collaboration increased for many providers and families. Qualitative analyseshighlighted barriers to AAC service provision for emergent bilinguals who use AACthat were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as factors thatfacilitated collaboration and family engagement. CONCLUSION: These findingssuggest that, despite challenges, telepractice or hybrid services may be apromising approach to provide more culturally responsive, family-centered carefor emergent bilinguals who use AAC.

TI  - "Something for us": Co-development of the COVID-19 Social Site, a web app forlong-term care workers.
LID - 10.2196/38359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving confidence in and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines andboosters among long-term care workers (LTCWs) is a crucial public health goal,given their role in the care of the elderly and people at risk. While difficultto reach with workplace communication interventions, most LTCWs regularly usesocial media and smartphones. Various social media interventions have improvedattitudes and uptake for other vaccines and hold promise for the LTCW population.OBJECTIVE: e aimed to develop a curated social web app (interactive website) toincrease COVID-19 vaccine confidence (three-arm randomized trial underway).METHODS: Following user-centric design and participatory research approaches, we undertook three steps: 1) content identification, 2) platform development, and 3)community building. A LTCW and stakeholder advisory group provided iterativeinput. For content identification, we identified topics of concern about COVID-19vaccines via desktop research (published literature, public opinion polls andsocial media monitoring), refined by interviewing and polling LTCWs. We alsoconducted a national online panel survey. We curated and fact-checked posts from popular social media platforms that addressed the identified concerns. Duringplatform development, we solicited preferences for design and functionality viainterviews and user experience (UX) testing with LTCWs. We also identified bestpractices for online community building, like comment moderation. RESULTS: In theinterviews (n=9), we found three themes: LTCWs 1) are proud of their work butfeel undervalued; 2) have varying levels of trust in COVID-19 relatedinformation, and 3) would welcome a curated COVID-19 resource that is easy tounderstand and use. Desktop research, LTCW interviews and our national onlinepanel survey (n=592) found participants are interested in information aboutCOVID-19 in general, vaccine benefits, vaccine risks, and vaccine development.Content identification resulted in 434 posts addressing these topic areas, with209 uploaded to the final web app. Our LTCW poll (n=8) revealed preferences forpersonal stories and video content. The platform we developed is an accessibleWordPress-based social media web app, refined through formal (n=3) and informalUX testing. Users can sort posts by topic or subtopic and react to or comment on them. To build an online community, we recruited three LTCW 'communityambassadors' and instructed them to encourage discussion, acknowledge concernsand offer factual information on COVID-19 vaccines. We also set 'communitystandards' for the web app. CONCLUSIONS: An iterative, user-centric,participatory approach led to the launch of an accessible social media web appwith curated content for COVID-19 vaccines targeting LTCWs in the U.S. Throughour trial, we will determine if this approach successfully improves vaccineconfidence. If so, a similar social media resource could be used to developcurated social media interventions in other populations and with other publichealth goals. CLINICALTRIAL: This effort is part of a broader clinical trial;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05168800.

AB  - The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, such as the Omicron variants which arehighly transmissible and immune evasive, underscores the need to developtherapeutic antibodies with broad neutralizing activities. Here, we used theLIBRA-seq technology, which identified SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells viaDNA-barcoding and subsequently single cell sequenced BCRs, to identify anantibody, SW186, which could neutralize major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,including Beta, Delta, and Omicron, as well as SARS-CoV-1. The cryo-EM structure of SW186 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike proteinshowed that SW186 interacted with an epitope of the RBD that is not at theinterface of its binding to the ACE2 receptor but highly conserved among SARScoronaviruses. This epitope encompasses a glycosylation site (N343) of the viral spike protein. Administration of SW186 in mice after they were infected withSARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, or Delta variants reduced the viral loads in the lung.These results demonstrated that SW186 neutralizes diverse SARS coronaviruses bybinding to a conserved RBD epitope, which could serve as a target for furtherantibody development.

PG  - e0269421
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269421 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burnout is associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19. Fewstudies have examined burnout prevalence related to healthcare workers during thepandemic. This study investigated the burnout prevalence and contributing factorsamong HCWs, including medical staff and support staff, during the COVID-19pandemic in an urban community in Thailand. METHODS: A cross-sectional onlinesurvey was distributed among HCWs in Bangkok, Thailand, from July-August 2021.The independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used tocompare the contributing factors and burnout items. Variable factors associatedwith burnout among HCWs were used in multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: A total of 517 HCWs' survey responses were received. Most participants weremedical staff (55.3%), female (83.4%), and over the age of 35 (59.4%); mostparticipants (65.6%) did not have any diseases but had family members that did(63.6%). The prevalence of overall burnout presented among medical staff (25.9%).The results of the multiple linear regression models found that female (vs. male,beta 0.088; 95% CI 0.033, 6.614) was higher associated with overall burnoutscore. In addition, hours of sleep as > 6 hr./day (vs. </= 6 hr./day, beta-0.120; 95% CI -6.012, -0.969) was lower associated with overall burnout score.CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of addressing burnout amongHCWs, in which female medical staff who slept less than six hours per day wereassociated with burnout. Our study further suggested that both intervention andidentification are needed of frontline HCWs to prevent and reduce the risk ofburnout, as the proportion of females compared to males is high. Thus, thegovernment should provide support in these areas to prevent a humanitariancrisis.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270843 [doi]
AB  - This article tries to explore consumer attitudes regarding a balanced diet anddaily calorie intake monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It hasbecome vital to boost people's immunity because of reoccurring diseases such asCOVID-19, Ebola, and other chronic diseases such as diabetes, thyroid disease,etc. Healthy diets are important for supporting immune systems and keeping track of daily calorie consumption is an accompaniment to this. The research onattitudes toward a balanced diet is reviewed in this empirical study. Researchersemployed a tri-component attitude model to assess consumer attitudes about abalanced diet and to track daily calorie consumption. A sample of 400 respondentswas surveyed and data were collected with a structured questionnaire. The datawere analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The majority of respondents were found to lack declarative knowledge of both a balanced diet and daily calorie consumption. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumerattitudes about a healthy diet and daily calorie intake were effectivelyevaluated using beliefs, affection, and intentions. The repercussions for thegovernment and business community were discussed. This study also evaluates theusefulness of the tri-component attitude model in the Indian context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that up to 70% of COVID-19 survivorsdevelop post-COVID symptoms during the following months after infection. Fatigue and dyspnea seem to be the most prevalent post-COVID symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Toanalyze whether a tele-rehabilitation exercise program is able to improveself-perceived physical exertion in patients with post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea.METHODS: Sixty-eight COVID-19 survivors exhibiting post-COVID fatigue and dyspneaderived to four Primary Health Care centers located in Madrid were enrolled inthis quasi-experimental study. A tele-rehabilitation program based on patienteducation, physical activity, airway clearing, and breathing exerciseinterventions was structured on eighteen sessions (3 sessions/week).Self-perceived physical exertion during daily living activities, dyspneaseverity, health-related quality of life and distance walked and changes inoxygen saturation and heart rate during the 6-Minute walking test were assessedat baseline, after the program and at 1- and 3-months follow-up periods. RESULTS:Daily living activities, dyspnea severity and quality of life improvedsignificantly at all follow-ups (p<0.001). Additionally, a significant increasein oxygen saturation before and after the 6-Minute Walking test was found whencompared with baseline (P<0.001). Heart rate adaptations at rest were foundduring the follow-up periods (P = 0.012). Lower perceived exertion before andafter the 6-Minute Walking test were also observed, even if larger distance were walked (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Tele-rehabilitation programs could be an effective strategy to reduce post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea in COVID-19 survivors. Inaddition, it could also reduce the economic burden of acute COVID-19, reaching a greater number of patients and releasing Intensive Unit Care beds for prioritizedpatients with a severe disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate racial and ethnic differences in mortality among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after adjusting forbaseline characteristics and comorbidities. METHODS: This retrospective cohortstudy at 13 acute care facilities in the New York City metropolitan area includedsequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020.Last day of follow up was July 31, 2020. Patient demographic information,including race/ethnicity and comorbidities, were collected. The primary outcomewas in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 10 869 patients were included inthe study (median age, 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) 54-77; range, 18-107years]; 40.5% female). In adjusted time-to-event analysis, increased age, malesex, insurance type (Medicare and Self-Pay), unknown smoking status, and a higherscore on the Charlson Comorbidity Index were significantly associated with higherin-hospital mortality. Adjusted risk of hospital mortality for Black, Asian,Hispanic, multiracial/other, and unknown race/ethnicity patients were similar to risk for White patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a large diverse cohort of patientshospitalized with COVID-19, patients from racial/ethnic minorities experiencedsimilar mortality risk as White patients.

TI  - Assessing the influence of French vaccine critics during the two first years ofthe COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - e0271157
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271157 [doi]
AB  - When the threat of COVID-19 became widely acknowledged, many hoped that thispandemic would squash "the anti-vaccine movement". However, when vaccines startedarriving in rich countries at the end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine hesitancymight be an issue even in the context of this major pandemic. Does it mean thatthe mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one of the maincauses of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this paper, we wish tocontribute to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic bylooking at one of the many mechanisms which can cause reticence towards vaccines:the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to influence a wider public on social media. We analyze the evolution of debates over the COVID-19 vaccine on theFrench Twittosphere, during two first years of the pandemic, with a particularattention to the spreading capacity of vaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did vaccine-critical contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the main actors in the diffusion of these contents? While debatesover vaccines experienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share ofvaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limitednumber of short periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing the community structure of the re-tweets hyper-graph, we reconstruct the mesoscalestructure of the information flows, identifying and characterizing the majorcommunities of users. We analyze their role in the information ecosystem: thelargest right-wing community has a typical echo-chamber behavior collecting allthe vaccine-critical tweets from outside and recirculating it inside thecommunity. The smaller left-wing community is less permeable to vaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once adopted.

PG  - e0272537
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272537 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is found to be one of the external stimuli that greatlyaffects mobility of people, leading to a shift of transportation modes towardsprivate individual ones. To properly explain the change in people's transportbehavior, especially in pre- and post- pandemic periods, a tensor-based frameworkis herein proposed and applied to Pun Pun-the only public bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand-where multidimensional trip data of Pun Pun are decomposedinto four different modes related to their spatial and temporal dimensions by anon-negative Tucker decomposition approach. According to our computationalresults, the first pandemic wave has a sizable influence not only on Pun Pun but also on other modes of transportation. Nonetheless, Pun Pun is relatively moreresilient, as it recovers more quickly than other public transportation modes. Interms of trip patterns, we find that, prior to the pandemic, trips made duringweekdays are dominated by business trips with two peak periods (morning andevening peaks), while those made during weekends are more related to leisureactivities as they involve stations nearby a public park. However, after thefirst pandemic wave ends, the patterns of weekday trips have been drasticallychanged, as the number of business trips sharply drops, while that of educationaltrips connecting metro/subway stations with a major educational institute in the region significantly rises. These findings may be regarded as a reflection of theever-changing transport behavior of people seeking a sustainable mode of private transport, with a more positive outlook on the use of bicycle-sharing system inBangkok, Thailand.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are no clear data about the incidence and the prophylacticstrategies of arterial and venous thromboembolic events (TE) in COVID-19ambulatory patients. Thus, we conducted this study to analyze thromboemboliccomplications in this setting and to assess thromboprophylaxis management andoutcomes in the real life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an observational studyincluding Covid-19 ambulatory patients. We assessed incidence of venous andarterial TE events as well as thromboprophylaxis outcomes and hemorrhagiccomplications. We defined high risk thrombo-embolic factor according to theBelgian guidelines which are the only guidelines that describedthromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 ambulatory patients. RESULTS: We included 2089patients with a mean age of 43+/-16 years. The incidence of 30 days venous andarterial TE complications in our cohort was 1%. Venous thromboemboliccomplications occurred in 0.8% and arterial thromboembolic complications occurredin 0.3%.We noted at least one high-risk TE factor in 18.5% of patients butthromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 22.5% of the cases, LMWH in 18.1%, andRivaroxaban in 3.7%. Hemorrhagic events occurred in eight patients (0.3%): fivepatients showed minor hemorrhagic events and three patients showed major ones(0.14%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications is very low in COVID-19 ambulatory patients. Paradoxically, thereis an over prescription of thrombo-prophylaxis in this population.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is alarmingly a global health catastrophe that has created an unprecedented mental health decline especially in young adults, who have been noted to be a vulnerable population. In this study, we investigated theprevalence of depression and anxiety in university students in China and Africaduring the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant factors contributing to theprevalence of anxiety and depression, the differences in factors affecting thedifferent groups being investigated and to emphasize that psychologicalintervention are as important as the physical interventions during and after the pandemic. The study was conducted through online surveys, with 684 participantsusing Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7standardized scales. Comparing all groups combined, of the 636 participants, 361 (56.8%) had depression and 227 (35.7%) had anxiety. Chi squared tests atsignificance level (P<0.05) showed that country of citizenship, religion,parents' educational background, household monthly income and, having familymembers with COVID-19 variables were strongly associated with depression andanxiety. In contrast, age, gender, educational background, and major showed nosignificant association. Comparing the individual groups separately using chisquare (P<0.05), the Chinese students in China group had 35.6% with depressionand 13.1% with anxiety. The variable associated with both depression and anxiety was education major, with depression only was parent's educational background andwith anxiety only was gender. The African students in China group had 70.3% with depression and 45.0% with anxiety. Gender was strongly associated with bothdepression and anxiety, and religion and having family members with COVID-19 withanxiety only. Africans in Africa had 66.0% with depression and 50.5% withanxiety. Educational background was strongly associated with depression. Therewas no statistically significant variable for anxiety. Chi square test showed astatistically significant difference in depression and anxiety levels with theChinese group compared to both African groups, and no significant differencebetween both African groups. Our findings demonstrated that COVID-19 had anegative psychological impact on university students. Therefore, more attentionshould be put on youth's mental health during this pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether anakinra, an interleukin-1receptorinhibitor, could improve outcome in moderate COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial, we enrolled adults with COVID-19 requiring oxygen. We randomly assigned patients to receive intravenous anakinra plus optimizedstandard of care (oSOC) vs. oSOC alone. The primary outcome was treatment successat day 14 defined as patient alive and not requiring mechanical ventilation orextracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Between 27th April and 6th October 2020, we enrolled 71 patients (240 patients planned to been enrolled): 37 wereassigned to the anakinra group and 34 to oSOC group. The study ended prematurely by recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board due to safety concerns.On day 14, the proportion of treatment success was significantly lower in theanakinra group 70% (n = 26) vs. 91% (n = 31) in the oSOC group: riskdifference-21 percentage points (95% CI, -39 to -2), odds ratio 0.23 (95% CI,0.06 to 0.91), p = 0.027. After a 28-day follow-up, 9 patients in the anakinragroup and 3 in the oSOC group had died. Overall survival at day 28 was 75% (95%CI, 62% to 91%) in the anakinra group versus 91% (95% CI, 82% to 100%) (p = 0.06)in the oSOC group. Serious adverse events occurred in 19 (51%) patients in theanakinra group and 18 (53%) in the oSOC group (p = 0.89). CONCLUSION: This trial did not show efficacy of anakinra in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore,contrary to our hypothesis, we found that anakinra was inferior to oSOC inpatients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, there are no studies of COVID-19 cases and deaths in theNavajo Nation, US. The primary objective of this manuscript is to understandwhether counties with a higher proportion of Navajo (Dine) population also hadhigher cases and deaths of COVID-19 and whether these dropped with vaccination.METHOD: We undertook a cross-sectional analysis of county level data from March16, 2020-May 11, 2021. Data were obtained from public repositories and the USCensus for the Navajo Nation, including northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and northwestern New Mexico. The primary outcome measure is the number ofindividuals with confirmed cases or deaths of COVID-19. A secondary outcome wasCOVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The 11 counties in Navajo Nation have a widevariation in the percent Navajo population, the resources available (ICU beds andoccupancy), and COVID-19 outcomes. Overall, there was a substantial increase inthe number of cases from March 16 -July 16, 2020 (the height of the pandemic)with a doubling time of 10.12 days on Navajo Nation. The percent Navajopopulation was a strong predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths per millionpopulation. COVID-19 vaccinations were inversely associated with COVID-19 casesand deaths in these counties. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic on the NavajoNation is a story of resilience. Navajo Nation was one of the hardest hit areasof the United States, with peak cases and deaths due to COVID-19. With anaggressive vaccination effort, these cases and deaths were strikingly curtailed, showing the resilience of the Navajo (Dine) people.

PG  - e0269962
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269962 [doi]
AB  - Five endophytic bacterial isolates were studied to identify morphologically andbiochemically, according to established protocols and further confirmed by 16SrDNA Sanger sequencing, as Priestia megaterium, Staphylococcus caprae,Neobacillus drentensis, Micrococcus yunnanensis, and Sphingomonas paucimobiliz,which were then tested for phytohormone, ammonia, and hydrolytic enzymeproduction. Antioxidant compounds total phenolic content (TPC), and totalflavonoid content (TFC) were assessed by using bacterial crude extracts obtained from 24-hour shake-flask culture. Phylogenetic tree analysis of those identified isolates shared sequence similarities with the members of Bacillus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas species, and after GenBank submission, accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences were found to be MW494406, MW494408,MW494401, MW494402, and MZ021340, respectively. In silico analysis was performed to identify their bioactive genes and compounds in the context of bioactivesecondary metabolite production with medicinal value, where nine significantbioactive compounds according to six different types of bioactive secondarymetabolites were identified, and their structures, gene associations, andprotein-protein networks were analyzed by different computational tools andservers, which were reported earlier with their antimicrobial, anti-infective,antioxidant, and anti-cancer capabilities. These compounds were then docked tothe 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of the novel SARS-COV-2. Docking scoreswere then compared with 3CLpro reference inhibitor (lopinavir), and dockedcompounds were further subjected to ADMET and drug-likeness analyses.Ligand-protein interactions showed that two compounds (microansamycin andaureusimine) interacted favorably with coronavirus 3CLpro. Besides, in silicoanalysis, we also performed NMR for metabolite detection whereas threemetabolites (microansamycin, aureusimine, and stenothricin) were confirmed fromthe 1H NMR profiles. As a consequence, the metabolites found from NMR dataaligned with our in-silico analysis that carries a significant outcome of thisresearch. Finally, Endophytic bacteria collected from medicinal plants canprovide new leading bioactive compounds against target proteins of SARS-COV-2,which could be an effective approach to accelerate drug innovation anddevelopment.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can cause some individuals to experience chronic symptoms.Rates and predictors of chronic COVID-19 symptoms are not fully elucidated.OBJECTIVE: To examine occurrence and patterns of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV2infection (PASC) symptomatology and their relationship with demographics, acuteCOVID-19 symptoms and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses. METHODS: Amulti-stage observational study was performed of adults (>/=18 years) from 5 USstates. Participants completed two rounds of electronic surveys (May-July 2020;April-May 2021) and underwent testing to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein IgGantibody testing. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify clusters of chronic COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 390 adults (median [25%ile, 75%ile] age: 42 [31, 54] years) with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies completed the follow-upsurvey; 92 (24.7%) had >/=1 chronic COVID-19 symptom, with 11-month medianduration of persistent symptoms (range: 1-12 months). The most common chronicCOVID-19 symptoms were fatigue (11.3%), change in smell (9.5%) or taste (5.6%),muscle or joint aches (5.4%) and weakness (4.6%). There were significantly higherproportions of >/=1 persistent COVID-19 symptom (31.5% vs. 18.6%; Chi-square, P =0.004), and particularly fatigue (15.8% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.008) and headaches (5.4% vs. 1.0%, P = 0.011) in females compared to males. Chronic COVID-19 symptoms werealso increased in individuals with >/=6 acute COVID-19 symptoms, Latent classanalysis revealed 4 classes of symptoms. Latent class-1 (change of smell andtaste) was associated with lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels; class-2 and 3(multiple chronic symptoms) were associated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and more severe acute COVID-19 infection. LIMITATIONS: Ambulatory cohortwith less severe acute disease. CONCLUSION: Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infectioncommonly experience chronic symptoms, most commonly fatigue, changes in smell or taste and muscle/joint aches. Female sex, severity of acute COVID-19 infection,and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were associated with the highest risk ofhaving chronic COVID-19 symptoms.

AB  - Commemorating the 2021 ASEAN Dengue Day and advocacy for World Dengue Day, theInternational Society for Neglected Tropical Diseases (ISNTD) and Asian DengueVoice and Action (ADVA) Group jointly hosted the ISNTD-ADVA World Dengue DayForum-Cross Sector Synergies in June 2021. The forum aimed to achieveinternational and multisectoral coordination to consolidate global dengue controland prevention efforts, share best practices and resources, and improve globalpreparedness. The forum featured experts around the world who shared theirinsight, research experience, and strategies to tackle the growing threat ofdengue. Over 2,000 healthcare care professionals, researchers, epidemiologists,and policy makers from 59 countries attended the forum, highlighting the urgency for integrated, multisectoral collaboration between health, environment,education, and policy to continue the march against dengue. Sustained vectorcontrol, environmental management, surveillance improved case management,continuous vaccine advocacy and research, capacity building, politicalcommitment, and community engagement are crucial components of dengue control. A coordinated strategy based on science, transparency, timely and crediblecommunication, and understanding of human behavior is needed to overcome vaccine hesitancy, a major health risk further magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Theforum announced a strong call to action to establish World Dengue Day to improve global awareness, share best practices, and prioritize preparedness in the fight against dengue.

AB  - Disease development and progression are often associated with aberrantglycosylation, indicating that changes in biological fluid glycome maypotentially serve as disease signatures. The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19)pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)represents a significant threat to global human health. However, the effect ofSARS-CoV-2 infection on the overall serum N-glycomic profile has been largelyunexplored. Here, we extended our 96-well-plate-based high-throughput,high-sensitivity N-glycan profiling platform further with the aim of elucidating potential COVID-19-associated serum N-glycomic alterations. Use of this platform revealed both similarities and differences between the serum N-glycomicfingerprints of COVID-19 positive and control cohorts. Although there were nospecific glycan peaks exclusively present or absent in COVID-19 positive cohort, this cohort showed significantly higher levels of glycans and variability. On thecontrary, the overall N-glycomic profiles for healthy controls werewell-contained within a narrow range. From the serum glycomic analysis, we wereable to deduce changes in different glycan subclasses sharing certain structural features. Of significance was the hyperbranched and hypersialylated glycans andtheir derived glycan subclass traits. T-distributed stochastic neighbourembedding (tSNE) and hierarchical heatmap clustering analysis were performed toidentify 13 serum glycomic variables that potentially distinguished the COVID-19 positive from healthy controls. Such serum N-glycomic changes described hereinmay indicate or correlate to the changes in serum glycoproteins upon COVID-19infection. Furthermore, mapping the serum N-glycome following SARS-CoV-2infection may help us better understand the disease and enable "Long-COVID"surveillance to capture the full spectrum of persistent symptoms.

TI  - Cardiac megakaryocytes in SARS-CoV-2 positive autopsies.
LID - 10.1111/his.14734 [doi]
AB  - Thromboembolic phenomena are an important complication of infection by severeacute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Increasing focus on management ofthe thrombotic complications of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led tofurther investigation into the role of platelets, and their precursor cell, themegakaryocyte, during disease course. Previously published post-mortemevaluations of patients who succumbed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) havereported the presence of megakaryocytes in the cardiac microvasculature. Ourseries evaluated a cohort of autopsies performed on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in 2020 (n = 36) and pre-pandemic autopsies performed in early 2020 (n = 12) and selected to represent comorbidities common in cases of severe COVID-19 inaddition to infectious and non-infectious pulmonary disease and thromboembolicphenomena. Cases were assessed for the presence of cardiac megakaryocytes andcorrelate with the presence of pulmonary emboli and laboratory plateletparameters and inflammatory markers. Cardiac megakaryocytes were detected in 64% (23/36) of COVID-19 autopsies, and 40% (5/12) pre-pandemic autopsies, withaverages of 1.77 and 0.84 megakaryocytes per cm(2) , respectively. Within theCOVID-19 cohort, autopsies with detected megakaryocytes had significantly higher platelet counts compared with cases throughout; other platelet parameters werenot statistically significant between groups. Although studies have supported arole of platelets and megakaryocytes in the response to viral infections,including SARS-CoV-2, our findings suggest cardiac megakaryocytes may berepresentative of a non-specific inflammatory response and are frequent in, butnot exclusive to, COVID-19 autopsies.

PG  - 988-992
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7131a2 [doi]
AB  - The NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) COVID-19 vaccine is a recombinant spike (rS) proteinnanoparticle vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant to protect against infection withSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. On July 13, 2022, the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Novavaxvaccine for primary COVID-19 immunization of unvaccinated adults aged >/=18years, administered as 2 doses (5 mug rS and 50 mug Matrix-M adjuvant in eachdose) 3 weeks apart (1). On July 19, 2022, the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of the Novavax vaccine in persons aged >/=18 years for the prevention of COVID-19.* In theper-protocol(dagger) efficacy analysis, vaccine efficacy (VE) against reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19was 89.6% (95% CI = 82.4%-93.8%). The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 wasthe predominant circulating variant during the period of case accrual for VEassessments. Cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in temporalassociation with vaccination, suggesting a possible causal relationship. The ACIPrecommendation for the use of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is interim and will beupdated as additional information becomes available. The adjuvanted, proteinsubunit-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine provides an additional option forunvaccinated adults, increasing flexibility for the public and for vaccineproviders. Vaccination is important for protection against COVID-19.

AB  - Post-COVID-19 (post-COVID) symptoms and conditions* are new, recurring, orongoing health problems that occur 4 or more weeks after infection withSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Previous studies have characterized and estimated the incidence of post-COVID conditions among adults (1,2), but dataamong children and adolescents are limited (3-8). Using a large medical claimsdatabase, CDC assessed nine potential post-COVID signs and symptoms (symptoms)and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among 781,419 U.S. children andadolescents aged 0-17 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (patients withCOVID-19) compared with 2,344,257 U.S. children and adolescents withoutrecognized COVID-19 (patients without COVID-19) during March 1, 2020-January 31, 2022. The analysis identified several symptoms and conditions with elevatedadjusted hazard ratios among patients with COVID-19 (compared with thosewithout). The highest hazard ratios were recorded for acute pulmonary embolism(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99),venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32),and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this studypopulation. Conversely, symptoms and conditions that were most common in thisstudy population had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were patients without to experience respiratory signs andsymptoms, symptoms of mental conditions, muscle disorders, neurologicalconditions, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, and sleepingdisorders. COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligiblechildren and adolescents, are critical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection andsubsequent illness, including post-COVID symptoms and conditions (9).

TI  - Infectious Disease Underreporting Is Predicted by Country-Level Preparedness,Politics, and Pathogen Severity.
LID - 10.1089/hs.2021.0197 [doi]
AB  - Underreporting of infectious diseases is a pervasive challenge in public healththat has emerged as a central issue in characterizing the dynamics of theCOVID-19 pandemic. Infectious diseases are underreported for a range of reasons, including mild or asymptomatic infections, weak public health infrastructure, andgovernment censorship. In this study, we investigated factors associated withcross-country and cross-pathogen variation in reporting. We performed aliterature search to collect estimates of empirical reporting rates, calculatedas the number of cases reported divided by the estimated number of true cases.This literature search yielded a dataset of reporting rates for 32 pathogens,representing 52 countries. We combined epidemiological and social science theory to identify factors specific to pathogens, country health systems, and politicsthat could influence empirical reporting rates. We performed generalized linearregression to test the relationship between the pathogen- and country-specificfactors that we hypothesized could influence reporting rates, and the reportingrate estimates that we collected in our literature search. Pathogen- andcountry-specific factors were predictive of reporting rates. Deadlier pathogensand sexually transmitted diseases were more likely to be reported. Countryepidemic preparedness was positively associated with reporting completeness,while countries with high levels of media bias in favor of incumbent governments were less likely to report infectious disease cases. Underreporting is a complex phenomenon that is driven by factors specific to pathogens, country healthsystems, and politics. In this study, we identified specific and measurablecomponents of these broader factors that influence pathogen- and country-specificreporting rates and used model selection techniques to build a model that canguide efforts to diagnose, characterize, and reduce underreporting. Furthermore, this model can characterize uncertainty and correct for bias in reportedinfectious disease statistics, particularly when outbreak-specific empiricalestimates of underreporting are unavailable. More precise estimates can informcontrol policies and improve the accuracy of infectious disease models.

TI  - Two large-scale global studies on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy over time: Culture, uncertainty avoidance, and vaccine side-effect concerns.
LID - 10.1037/pspa0000320 [doi]
AB  - This article presents one of the largest and broadest investigations intoCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a burning issue that poses a global threat. First, I provide a timely review of the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancyidentified by prior studies. More importantly, I advance a dynamic, culturalpsychological perspective to examine how the cultural dimension of uncertaintyavoidance partly explains national differences in initial vaccine hesitancy. Totrack global vaccine hesitancy over time, I leveraged a daily survey of 979,971individuals in 67 countries/territories (October 2020 to March 2021) and another daily survey of over 11 million individuals in 244 countries/territories(December 2020 to March 2021). To increase sample representativeness, bothsurveys used algorithms to correct for nonresponse bias and coverage bias.Consistent with my theoretical perspective, people in higher (vs. lower)uncertainty avoidance cultures had higher vaccine hesitancy initially (late 2020)as a function of greater vaccine side-effect concerns, but these differencesdecreased over time as COVID-19 vaccine uptake became prevalent. These findingswere robust after controlling for other cultural dimensions, demographics,COVID-19 severity, government response stringency, socioeconomic indicators,common vaccine coverage, and religiosity. Understanding cultural differences invaccine hesitancy is important, as delaying vaccination for even a short periodcan increase morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Vulnerability reawakened: Increased substance use among aging traumatizedveterans during COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001267 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study prospectively assesses the implication of (a) exposure todistant trauma of war captivity, (b) stressful life events across the life span, and (c) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories and current PTSD, onsubstance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: One hundred and twentyIsraeli ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and 65 matched veterans of the 1973 YomKippur War filled out self-report questionnaires in 4 waves of assessment (T1-18,T2-30, T3-35, and T4-42 years after the war). A fifth wave of assessment (T5) wasconducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 47 years after the war. RESULTS:Whereas in the earlier assessments (T1-T4) war captivity was not related tosubstance use, during the COVID-19 pandemic (T5) ex-POWs reported higher increaseof use of alcohol, tranquilizers, cannabis, and sleep medications than comparableveterans. War-induced PTSD trajectories that were prospectively measured between T1-T4, and concurrent PTSD during the pandemic (T5) were related to increase insubstance use during the pandemic (T5). CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate thelong-term effects of both earlier experience of severe traumatic stress in young adulthood and the resultant PTSD trajectories, as reflected in increasedsubstance use among the elderly, in the face of subsequent calamity.

TI  - Burnout following moral injury and dehumanization: A study of distress amongItalian medical staff during the first COVID-19 pandemic period.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Italy was the first country outside Asia to deal with the early phaseof the COVID-19 pandemic, and health care facilities and medical staff were notfully prepared. Research worldwide has documented the enormous effect of theCOVID-19 pandemic on health care providers' mental health, including experiences of dehumanization, but less work has focused on factors which may influence thedevelopment of these outcomes in response to COVID-19-related stress. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association of dehumanization, self-efficacy, andalienation to burnout, depression, and PTSD among medical staff. Potentialmoderators included moral injury, professional role, COVID workload, and work in a critical care unit (CCU). METHOD: Participants were recruited through theInternet. The sample consisted of 270 medical staff members who completed aself-report survey online. Instruments included: Human Traits Attribution Scalefor dehumanization; NYP-Queens Survey-Self-Efficacy Subscale for self-efficacy;Moral Injury Events Scale for moral injury; Alienation Scale for alienation;PTSD-8 for posttraumatic stress disorder; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 fordepression; and a single item for burnout. The analytic plan included ANOVAs,zero-order correlations, logistic regression analyses, multiple linear regressionmodels, and parallel mediation. RESULTS: Results show that dehumanization wasassociated with higher levels of burnout, PTSD, and depressive symptoms andeffects were consistent across professional role and work context. Dehumanizationwas significantly associated with PTSD symptoms only among those who hadincreased COVID-19-related caseloads. Moral injury was positively associated withdehumanization, displayed an independent association with all 3 mental healthoutcomes, over and above dehumanization, and tended to exacerbate the effects of dehumanization. The effect sizes across analyses were small to medium.CONCLUSION: This research confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic stressed Italianmedical staff in a way not documented in the prepandemic literature. There is aneed to support staff in their complex relationships and communication withpatients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Posttraumatic growth as a moderator between pandemic-related distress and mental health symptoms in U.S. young adults.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001306 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compared to other age groups, young adults are at risk of sufferingCOVID-19 pandemic-related psychological problems. Prior research suggests thatsuch adverse events (like the pandemic) can initiate adaptive psychologicalchanges, referred to as posttraumatic growth (PTG); however, limited studies haveexamined the moderating role of PTG among young adults in the United States with regard to COVID-19-related distress. Thus, this study examines whetherpandemic-related distress has a differential effect on young adults' mentalhealth symptoms based on varying levels of PTG. METHOD: Using the data from 661participants who completed all three waves of the CARES study (T(1): April-August2020; T(2): September 2020-March 2021; T(3): April-May 2021), a moderatoranalysis was performed using the PROCESS Macro to determine the moderating effectof PTG. RESULTS: In our data, higher levels of PTG buffered the effects ofpandemic-related distress from 2020 on depressive symptoms in 2021; PTG did notshow a moderating effect with anxiety as an outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Understandingthe moderating role of PTG would help to further understand the mental healthtrajectories of young adults in the United States who are particularly distressedby the pandemic. Our findings suggest the importance of further exploringcontributors to PTG for young adults, particularly among those who haveexperienced high levels of pandemic-related distress to date.

TI  - A model of collaborative immigration advocacy to prevent policy-based trauma and harm.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001330 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research suggests that antiimmigrant policies enacted in the UnitedStates, magnified during the 2016-2020 period, propagate widespread trauma acrosscommunities of immigrants (von Werthern et al., 2018). While these policies harm all groups of immigrants, structural conditions (e.g., lack of documentationstatus, race, ethnicity, country of origin, and other social and legaldeterminants) shape how they are experienced. To address the widespread traumaticharm inflicted by racist and xenophobic policies, a group of leaders from eightDivisions of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National LatinxPsychological Association (NLPA) launched an Interdivisional Immigration Project (IIP). METHOD: The IIP served to develop a model for collaborative advocacy,bringing together mental health providers (i.e., psychologists, social workers), allied professionals, and immigration activists from community organizationsacross the country. This model was developed over the course of 1 year,coinciding with the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and theamplified movement for racial justice. RESULTS: This article describes the keycomponents of the IIP collaborative advocacy model: (a) structuring leadership ina democratic and egalitarian manner, (b) centering and uplifting immigrantvoices, (c) forming teams across five U.S. regions, (d) facilitating criticaldialogues grounded in liberatory practices, (e) centering trauma and empowerment,and (f) developing advocacy strategies. The IIP collaborative advocacy model isinforming advocacy to protect immigrants from harm. DISCUSSION: This model may beused as the basis for ongoing humane immigration policy activism that centers thevoices of community activists, and that pushes psychologists and alliedprofessionals to use their positionality to support community-based efforts.(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Adding fuel to the fire? Examining exposure to potentially stressful or traumaticevents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income, Black families.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001336 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of many individuals. Whileemerging evidence has begun to document health (e.g., infection) and financial(e.g., job loss) consequences, less is known about the day-to-day experiences of some of the country's most vulnerable populations. The current study sought toaddress this gap in understanding by examining exposure to potentially stressful or traumatic experiences (PSTEs) and their relation to mental health amongpredominately low-income, African American/Black individuals. METHOD: Adultcaregivers (N = 110) from an ongoing longitudinal research project occurringprior the pandemic completed surveys about their exposure to COVID-19-specificPSTEs during the initial months of the pandemic. Information on participants was combined with pre-COVID-19 PSTE exposure and examined in relation to currentmental health functioning (e.g., depression). RESULTS: Findings indicated thatparticipants experienced several different types of COVID-19-specific PSTEsacross multiple domains, including home, work, social life, and health andwell-being. Results from model testing indicated that COVID-19-specific PSTEswere only associated with worry about COVID-19-specifically. Adulthood PSTEsprior to COVID-19 were also associated with current anxiety symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Among low-income, African American/Black individuals with a history of exposure to PSTEs, additional PSTEs experienced during the COVID-19 pandemicmay not contribute significantly to general mental health functioning above andbeyond pre-COVID-19 PSTE exposures. Taken together, research on PSTE exposurefrom the pandemic should make attempts to account for lifetime PSTE exposure tomost accurately evaluate current mental health concerns, especially amongmarginalized populations.

TI  - Short-term psychological outcomes of Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001323 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated how Australian community members (N = 318) indirectly and/or directly exposed to Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season differed in terms of psychological distress, posttraumatic growth, coping, physical health, andCOVID-19 anxiety. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study with a nonequivalentgroups design. Participants were over 18 years old, English proficient, andAustralian permanent residents or citizens living in Australia at some pointbetween June 2019 and February 2020. Participants completed a 10-minute anonymousonline survey 5 to 8 weeks following the bushfires. RESULTS: A descriptivediscriminant analysis revealed a statistically significant difference betweenbushfire exposure groups when considering our dependent variables of interestsimultaneously and adjusting for prior mental health assistance and priorexposure to natural disasters: F(10, 624) = 2.83, p = .002; V = .087, partialeta(2) = .043. The group centroid for the indirect-only exposure group (-.374)was substantially lower than that for the other 2 groups (direct only: .137;direct + indirect: .224), indicating that the indirect-only exposure group could be differentiated by the fact that they more frequently reported avoidant coping strategies and endorsed lower posttraumatic growth scores than the direct-onlyand direct + indirect exposure groups. The variance accounted for by thesediscriminant variables was 8.4%, indicating a very small effect. CONCLUSION: Our results point to a need to tailor and/or expand disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts such that they might benefit community members both directlyand indirectly exposed to bushfire events in Australia.

TI  - Distortions in time perception during collective trauma: Insights from a nationallongitudinal study during the COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001326 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During the protracted collective trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, lay of distorted perceptions of time (e.g., time slowing, days blurring together,uncertainty about the future) have been widespread. Known as "temporaldisintegration" in psychiatric literature, these distortions are associated with negative mental health consequences. However, the prevalence and predictors oftemporal disintegration are poorly understood. We examined perceptions of timepassing and their associations with lifetime stress and trauma andpandemic-related secondary stress as COVID-19 spread across the United States.METHOD: A probability-based national sample (N = 5,661) from the NORC AmeriSpeak online panel, which had completed a mental and physical health survey prior tothe pandemic, completed two surveys online during March 18-April 18, 2020, andSeptember 26-October 16, 2020. Distorted time perceptions and otherpandemic-related experiences were assessed. RESULTS: Present focus, blurringweekdays and weekdays together, and uncertainty about the future were commonexperiences reported by over 65% of the sample 6 months into the pandemic. Halfof the sample reported time speeding up or slowing down. Predictors of temporaldisintegration include prepandemic mental health diagnoses, dailypandemic-related media exposure and secondary stress (e.g., school closures,lockdown), financial stress, and lifetime stress and trauma exposure. CONCLUSION:During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, distortions in timeperception were very common and associated with prepandemic mental health,lifetime stress and trauma exposure, and pandemic-related media exposure andstressors. Given that temporal disintegration is a risk factor for mental health challenges, these findings have potential implications for public mental health.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude, Practices, and Vaccine Hesitancy Among the Latinx Community in Southern California Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey.
PG  - e38351

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Latinx population in the United States has experienced high ratesof infection, hospitalization, and death since the beginning of the COVID-19pandemic. There is little data on the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP)specifically in Latinx communities in the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed toassess COVID-19 KAP and vaccine hesitancy among a Latinx cohort in the earlystages of the COVID-19 pandemic (from July 2020 to October 2020), at a uniquetime when a vaccine was not available. METHODS: Participants aged >/=18 yearswere recruited at a primary care clinic in Southern California and asked toself-report sociodemographic characteristics, KAP, and vaccine hesitancy. Asubset of the participants answered the vaccine hesitancy assessment as it wasadded after the start of data collection. KAP items were summed to createcomposite scores, with higher scores reflecting increased COVID-19 knowledge,positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, and disease preventionpractices. Bivariate and multivariable regression models were fitted to testassociations between sociodemographic characteristics and KAP scores. For ouranalysis, we only included patients who self-identified as Latinx. RESULTS: Ourfinal data set included 265 participants. The participants had a mean age of 49(IQR 38.5-59) years, and 72.1% (n=191) were female, 77% (n=204) had at most ahigh school degree, 34.7% (n=92) had an annual income <US $25,000, and 11.7%(n=31) had previously tested positive for COVID-19. We found high knowledgeregarding transmission and spread; moderate knowledge regarding symptomsawareness; overall negative attitudes, which included high pessimism ingovernment public health efforts and high amounts of fear, anxiety, andfrustration due to COVID-19 pandemic; and moderate participation in preventivepractices. A college education was positively associated with a higher knowledge score than those without a college education (beta=0.14, 95% CI 0.01-1.60; P=.04)when adjusted for covariates. Male gender had a positive association withCOVID-19 attitude scores compared to female gender (beta=1.61, 95% CI 0.50-2.72; P=.05), and male gender was negatively associated with the COVID-19 practicesscore compared to female gender (beta=-0.16, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.06; P=.03), when both were adjusted for covariates. Among a subset of 203 patients, 26.6% (n=54)indicated that if the vaccine was available, they would not take a COVID-19vaccine, and 18.7% (n=38) were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge andpreventative practices in the population may have reflected effective publichealth messaging and the implementation of public health laws during the firstwave of the pandemic; however, the overall fear and anxiety may have reflectedthe negative impact that the pandemic had on vulnerable populations such as theLatinx community. Although our data are a reflection of a previous time in thepandemic, we believe it captures a critical time that can be used to provideunique insights regarding potential avenues to better protect the Latinxcommunities against future vaccine-resistant COVID-19 strains.

AB  - Our study demonstrates that neither 2020-convalescent plasma (CP) nor2019/2020-immunoglobulin (IVIG) neutralize Omicron subvariants BA.1 to BA.5. Incontrast, hyperimmune 2020-hCoV-2IG lots neutralized Omicron VOCs, similar to2022-CP from BA.1 breakthrough infections. Therefore, high-titer hCoV-2IG and CP could be evaluated for treatment of high-risk individuals infected withcirculating Omicron subvariants.

TI  - Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from adult index cases living with andwithout HIV in South Africa, 2020-2021: a case-ascertained, prospectiveobservational household transmission study.
LID - ciac640 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac640 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In South Africa, 19% of the adult population are living with HIV(LWH). Few data on the influence of HIV on SARS-CoV-2 household transmission are available. METHODS: We performed a case-ascertained, prospective householdtransmission study of symptomatic index SARS-CoV-2 cases LWH and HIV-uninfectedadults and their contacts in South Africa, October 2020 to September 2021.Households were followed up thrice weekly for 6 weeks to collect nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing. We estimated household cumulative infection risk (HCIR) andduration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (at cycle threshold value <30 as proxy for highviral load). RESULTS: We recruited 131 index cases and 457 household contacts.HCIR was 59% (220/373); not differing by index HIV status (60% [51/85] in casesLWH vs 58% [163/279] in HIV-uninfected cases, OR 1.0, 95%CI 0.4-2.3). HCIRincreased with index case age (35-59 years: aOR 3.4 95%CI 1.5-7.8 and >/=60years: aOR 3.1, 95%CI 1.0-10.1) compared to 18-34 years, and contacts' age, 13-17years (aOR 7.1, 95%CI 1.5-33.9) and 18-34 years (aOR 4.4, 95%CI 1.0-18.4)compared to <5 years. Mean positivity duration at high viral load was 7 days(range 2-17), with longer positivity in cases LWH (aHR 0.4, 95%CI 0.1-0.9).CONCLUSIONS: Index HIV status was not associated with higher HCIR, but cases LWH had longer positivity duration at high viral load. Adults aged >35 years weremore likely to transmit, individuals aged 13-34 to acquire SARS-CoV-2 in thehousehold. As HIV infection may increase transmission, health services mustmaintain HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy initiation.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused bysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The gold standardmethod for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 depends on quantitative reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction till now, which is time-consuming andrequires expensive instrumentation, and the confirmation of variants relies onfurther sequencing techniques. Herein, we first proposed a robusttechnique-methodology of electrochemical CRISPR sensing with the advantages ofrapid, highly sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2variant. To enhance the sensing capability, gold electrodes are uniformlydecorated with electro-deposited gold nanoparticles. Using DNA template identicalto SARS-CoV-2 Delta spike gene sequence as model, our biosensor exhibitsexcellent analytical detection limit (50 fM) and high linearity (R(2) = 0.987)over six orders of magnitude dynamic range from 100 fM to 10 nM without anynucleic-acid-amplification assays. The detection can be completed within 1 h withhigh stability and specificity which benefits from the CRISPR-Cas system.Furthermore, based on the wireless micro-electrochemical platform, the proposedbiosensor reveals promising application ability in point-of-care testing.

LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22024-w [doi]
AB  - The goal of the study here is to analyze and assess whether strict containmentpolicies to cope with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis areeffective interventions to reduce high numbers of infections and deaths. Ahomogenous sample of 31 countries is categorized in two sets: countries with highor low strictness of public policy to cope with COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Thefindings here suggest that countries with a low intensity of strictness haveaverage confirmed cases and fatality rates related to COVID-19 lower thancountries with high strictness in containment policies (confirmed cases are24.69% vs. 26.06% and fatality rates are 74.33% vs. 76.38%, respectively, incountries with low and high strictness of COVID-19 public policies ofcontainment). What this study adds is that high levels of strict restrictionpolicies may not be useful measures of control in containing the spread andnegative impact of pandemics similar to COVID-19 and additionally a highstrictness in containment policies generates substantial social and economiccosts. These findings can be explained with manifold socioeconomic andenvironmental factors that support transmission dynamics and circulation ofCOVID-19 pandemic. Hence, high levels of strictness in public policy (and also a high share of administering new vaccines) seem to have low effectiveness to stop pandemics similar to COVID-19 driven by mutant viral agents. These results heresuggest that the design of effective health policies for prevention andpreparedness of future pandemics should be underpinned in a good governance ofcountries and adoption of new technology, rather than strict and generalizedhealth polices having ambiguous effects of containment in society.

TI  - The perceived need for evidence-based COVID-19 management and Tele-education inthe North-East region of India: a cross-sectional survey.
LID - 10.1007/s10900-022-01076-6 [doi]
AB  - Due to the sudden rise in the cases of COVID-19 in the North-Eastern region ofIndia, this study was conducted to survey the felt needs of the medicalprofessionals with regards to education on the evidence-based management ofCOVID-19. A total of 25 North-East leaders were recruited and a baseline surveywas conducted through the digital medium. Out of 25 North-East leaders, 52% were undergoing training in evidence-based medicine in the capacity-building programfor evidence-based child health. Participants (48%) strongly agreed and 40%agreed on the possibility of enhanced care by capacity building in the areas ofCOVID-19 management through discussing cases. Out of 25 North East leaders, 48%agreed to join both as a speaker as well as a participant. Various prioritytopics on COVID-19 management e.g. childhood, adult, ocular manifestation, ICUmanagement, telemedicine, vaccines, lab protocols, psychological distress, andtreatment strategy have emerged. We have presented the findings of the surveywhich will help guide the mentoring program focusing on evidence-based managementof COVID-19 in remote areas through Tele-education.

TI  - Long-term use of burosumab for the treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia.
LID - 10.1007/s00198-022-06516-6 [doi]
AB  - Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome caused bytumoral overproduction of FGF-23. Due to local recurrence, we describe thelong-term efficacy and safety profile of burosumab, an anti-FGF-23 monoclonalantibody, in a TIO patient after three unsuccessfully surgical attempts.INTRODUCTION: TIO is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome caused by tumoraloverproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), resulting inhyperphospaturia, hypophosphatemia, and osteomalacia. Surgery is the onlydefinitive treatment, but tumor can locally recur, even after years from primary surgery. Furthermore, some tumors cannot be removed by surgery due to theirlocation. METHODS: We describe the case of a 54-year-old woman affected byrecurrent TIO who, after three unsuccessful surgical attempts of tumor removal,was treated with burosumab, an anti-FGF-23 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Thepatient was referred to our Bone Unit after experiencing several fractures indifferent sites, both traumatic and non-traumatic. At the time of firstevaluation, at the age of 46, serum-phosphate (SP) was 1.2 mg/dL (reference range(RR) 2.5-4.5), 24-h urinary phosphate was 842 mg (RR 400-1000), and intact-FGF-23was 117 pg/mL (RR 25-45). Imaging showed a metabolic pre-sacral lesion thatfirstly underwent to exploratory laparotomy. Then, patient underwent to surgical excision of tumor. After 18 months of well-being, tumor relapsed and even thesubsequent surgery was not able to completely remove it. Since 2015, patient was maintained in phosphorus supplements and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D3, but SP levels nevernormalized. In September 2019, she was started on burosumab, initially at thedose of 0.3 mg/kg/month, progressively increased to the current 0.8 mg/kg/month, with great improvement of pain, physical performance, and normalization of SPlevels. Burosumab was temporary and cautionary discontinued for COVID-19pneumonia, with a worsening of SP. After restart of burosumab, biochemistryreturned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first Europeanpatient affected by TIO treated with burosumab for more than 2 years. Burosumabis a promising therapy in the medical treatment of TIO refractory or not eligiblefor definitive surgery, with good efficacy and safety profile.

TI  - [Testing of practical surgical teaching at a distance-Experiences with a hybridOSCE in surgery].
LID - 10.1007/s00104-022-01650-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed medical teaching worldwide. Digitalteaching and examinations are successful for cognitive learning objectives,whereas practical skills had to be carried out predominantly in person understrict hygiene standards. AIM: This study presents the opportunities andchallenges of using a presence objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)at a distance with digital support. METHOD: Following surgical practical teachingan OSCE was conducted in presence, where students demonstrated practical skillsin one room while the examiners were connected via videoconference from anotherroom. Students were surveyed about the OSCE and sustained learning via astandardized online questionnaire after completion of the surgical teaching.Additionally, examiners were surveyed on their experiences. RESULTS: In theonline survey 40 students participated (25% of n= 157 students contacted) and 36 completed questionnaires were analyzed. Overall, the implementation of an OSCEeven under pandemic conditions was perceived as very positive by the students(92% of students n= 33). In particular, the acquisition of practical skills wasrated as very high. For 78% (n= 28) of the students, the acquisition ofcompetencies through the practical examination was particularly sustainable. The vast majority of students and examiners felt safe regarding infection controlbecause of the hygiene concept (92%, n= 33). Overall, 80 students achieved grade 1 (51%), 71 students grade 2 (45.2%) and 6 students grade 3 (3.8%) (grade 1= verygood, grade 6= very bad). CONCLUSION: Practical examinations are essential forchecking practical learning objectives and can be implemented at a distance with a well-developed hygiene concept and digital support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A sizable part of post-COVID syndrome meets the diagnostic criteriafor myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A doubling ofcases of ME/CFS within the next years is therefore projected. OBJECTIVES:Presentation of the current state of knowledge on ME/CFS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unsystematic review of the literature and of own contributions in research andpatient care. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: ME/CFS is a neuroimmunological disease,mostly infection-induced, usually persisting throughout life. Clinically it ischaracterized by fatigue lasting at least 6 months and the defining core feature of exercise intolerance (post-exertional malaise, PEM). Exercise intolerance isdefined as a worsening of symptoms after (even mild) everyday exertion, whichusually begins after several hours or on the following day, is still noticeableat least 14 h after exertion, and often lasts for several days (up to weeks orlonger). Furthermore, ME/CFS is characterized by pain, disturbances of sleep,thinking and memory, and dysregulation of the circulatory, endocrine, and immune systems. As a separate clinical entity, ME/CFS should be distinguished fromchronic fatigue, which occurs as a symptom of a range of very different diseases.The diagnosis of ME/CFS is made clinically using established internationaldiagnostic criteria and requires careful stepwise diagnosis to exclude otherdiagnoses. A causal therapy for ME/CFS has not been established; the focus is on symptoms relief, treatment of the often accompanying orthostatic intolerance, andassistance with anticipatory energy management (pacing).

RESULTS: After chronic fatigue,dyspnea is the most common symptom in patients with long COVID syndrome.Pathological findings are mainly found after a severe acute course of COVID-19and include radiological changes with characteristics of interstitial lungdiseases, restrictive ventilation patterns and limitations in diffusion capacity as the most common pathological finding. Although both symptoms and pathological pulmonary alterations improve over time, some patients may still suffer fromabnormalities months after the acute infection. The relevance of the pathologicalfindings, as well as the involvement of functional respiratory limitations,cardiopulmonary deconditioning, non-somatic causes and pre-existing lungdiseases, is currently unclear. The advanced diagnostic assessment thus focusses on high-risk patients and includes, in addition to imaging and pulmonary functiontests, a cardiopulmonary exercise test and, if the findings are unclear, anechocardiography to diagnose a pulmonary vascular component. The therapeuticoptions currently include treatment of the underlying causes of the symptoms(e.g. interstitial lung diseases, cough) according to the respective guidelinesand rehabilitation measures. DISCUSSION: The current knowledge about pulmonarymanifestations in long COVID patients is constantly being expanded, but due tolimited availability of clinical trials, there are still no evidence-basedguidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary manifestations in longCOVID syndrome.

AB  - There are currently no strategies available on how to deal with Long-COVID (COVID"coronavirus disease"). COVID-19 vaccination could be both a preemptive and atherapeutic option for the future. The evaluation of the available studies iscomplicated by varying definitions. There are, however, indications that(complete) COVID-19 vaccination is able not only to prevent symptomatic infectionbut also to reduce the risk of Long-COVID. In some patients with Long-COVID,symptoms are modified after (first and/or second) COVID-19 vaccination; however, there is no clear evidence for a real therapeutic effect on Long-COVID.

AB  - Between 10 and 20% of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suffer from symptoms up to weeks after initialinfection. The most frequently reported symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea,anosmia and ageusia, as well as headaches, joint pain, cough, cognitiveimpairment and impaired sleeping. After exclusion of other etiologies and symptomduration of more than 4 weeks after initial infection this is referred to as longCOVID. In contrast to acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific riskfactors have been identified as yet as being associated with the occurrence ofthis disease. Furthermore, there are varying hypotheses concerning thepathomechanism of long COVID. Dividing patients into groups is beneficial in the clinical context. Regardless of long COVID symptoms the risk of cardiovascularevents is increased even 1 year after COVID-19.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on digital practice in UK paediatric speech and languagetherapy and implications for the future: A national survey.
LID - 10.1111/1460-6984.12750 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures to reduce transmission risk has led to unprecedented digital transformation across health, education andsocial care services. This includes UK paediatric speech and language therapy(SLT), which sits at the crossroads of these services. Given the rapid onset ofthis pandemic-induced digital transition, there is now a need to capture, reflectand learn from the SLT profession so that benefits can be sustained, and barriersaddressed. AIMS: To survey the impact of COVID-19 remote working on UK paediatricSLTs' digital views and experiences using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivationand Behaviour (COM-B) model. METHODS & PROCEDURES: An online survey was conductedfrom May to October 2020. Respondents were asked to rate their use of technology in service delivery before and during the pandemic, to select factorsfacilitating digital practice, and to provide open-response aspirations for thefuture role of technology in paediatric SLT which were analysed thematicallyusing the COM-B behaviour change model. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: A total of 424 UKpaediatric SLTs responded to the survey. Findings indicate a marked increase inclinicians' perception of their frequency, convenience and confidence withdigital practice during COVID-19 compared with before the pandemic. Respondentsidentified that specialist training (27%), funding for workplace devices (22%)and supportive leadership (19%) were most likely to facilitate sustained digital practice. Clinicians hoped for a blended approach going forward with technologyenhancing existing best practice. Further prominent themes included digitalaccessibility for all and maintaining the increased opportunity formultidisciplinary working that videoconferencing has afforded. Moreservice-specific aspirations were bespoke technological solutions as well asparents/carers being able to engage remotely with school-based provisions.CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: During COVID-19, paediatric SLTs' recognition andacceptance of how technology can augment practice has accelerated, withparticular value being placed on inclusivity, choice, training, resources,leadership and indication of effectiveness. These are important considerations tohelp guide the profession towards the long-term digital enhancement of SLTservices. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject The COVID-19pandemic led to an unprecedented interest in the use of technology across SLTpractice. Studies are emerging nationally and internationally to identify thedigital priorities of the SLT workforce, the areas of digital SLT provision that are thriving or lacking, and the evidence to guide clinical practice and service development. What this study adds to existing knowledge This is the first UK-wideCOVID-19 survey solely focusing on the digital practice of paediatric SLTs. Thefindings provide critical insights into SLT perception of how practice has beenimpacted in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including digital trendsthat are service, condition and demographic specific. Tools and channels requiredto support sustained beneficial change are also discussed. What are the potentialor actual clinical implications of this work? This paper demonstrates thepotential for digital solutions to enhance SLT practice, as long asimplementation is guided by clinicians' experiences and perspectives. Thefindings lay groundwork for service development work, such as the creation oftraining packages, updating of clinical guidelines and care pathways, anddevelopment of processes to ensure equitable allocation of evidence-basedresources.

LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The WHO-5 is a brief measure of psychological well-being. Validitystudies for the WHO-5 are quite limited in sub-Saharan Africa and mostimportantly, no study has confirmed the unidimensional factor structure of theinstrument in Nigeria. The aim of this research is to evaluate the reliabilityand determine the unidimensional factor structure of the WHO-5 well-being indexin a population of medical doctors and nurses in Nigeria during the COVID-19pandemic. METHODS: Overall, 464 medical doctors and nurses from various parts of Nigeria, completed the assessment between April and July 2020. The participantscompleted the WHO-5 well-being index and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out. The internalconsistency of the WHO-5 was measured and external validity was determined aswell. RESULTS: The inter-item correlations among the WHO-5 items ranged from0.447 to 0.685. Internal consistency was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.868). Thecorrected item-total correlations ranged from 0.596 to 0.750 with a mean of0.693. PCA identified a single factor structure of the WHO-5. The WHO-5significantly correlated with the PHQ-9 (r = -0.590), ascertaining convergentvalidity. CONCLUSION: The WHO-5 demonstrated satisfactory reliability andvalidity in our study population. It is therefore a suitable measure for theassessment of the mental well-being of healthcare professionals in ourenvironment.

AB  - This article has three aims. First, to reflect on how conceptualizations of thepublic interest may have shifted due to COVID-19. Second, to focus on theimplications of regulatory responses for the health workforce and correspondinglessons as health leaders and systems transition from pandemic response topandemic recovery. Third, to identify how these lessons lead to potentialdirections for future research, connecting regulation in a whole-of-systemsapproach to health system safety and health workforce capacity andsustainability. Pandemic regulatory responses highlighted both strengths andlimitations of regulatory structures and frameworks. The COVID-19 pandemic mayhave introduced new considerations around regulating in the public interest,particularly as the impact of regulatory responses on the health workforcecontinues to be examined. Clearly articulating practitioner practice parameters, reducing barriers to practice, and working collaboratively with stakeholders wereprimary aspects of regulators' pandemic responses that impacted the healthworkforce.

LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has ravaged the world with significantimplications on the socio-economic and health status of individuals. Severalmeasures were put in place to curtail the pandemic especially movementrestrictions. The effect of this pandemic and the restriction measures couldfurther compound the health needs of PLWHA. This study thus described the trendin access to HIV/AIDS care services before and during the COVID-19 inducedlockdown and the possible consequences on their treatment outcome. METHODS: Asecondary analysis of client data was carried out at the HIV clinic of theNigerian Institute of Medical Research. The sociodemographic and clinical data[type of ART, duration on ART, clinical services 3-months before and during theCOVID-19 induced Lockdown] were extracted from the electronic medical records.Data obtained was analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0. RESULTS: The median ageof PLWHA was 45 years (IQR: 39-51), with the predominant age group being 25-49years (65.4%). The majority were females (68.7%), married (59.5%), had at leastsecondary education (82.8%), and employed (81.5%). The median duration on ART was102 months (IQR: 67-138) with the majority on non-Protease Inhibitor basedregimen (77.7%). In the 3 months before the lockdown, there was an increase indrug pick-up of approximately 25% over the booked appointment compared to adecline of 40% when the lockdown was enacted. CONCLUSION: The significant declinein drug pick-up during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic raises the need for measures toensure continued access to drugs and care among PLWHA.

TI  - Human Adenovirus Type 26 Infection Mediated by alphavbeta3 Integrin IsCaveolin-1-Dependent.
PG  - e0109722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01097-22 [doi]
AB  - Human adenovirus type 26 (HAdV26) has been recognized as a promising platform forvaccine vector development, and very recently vaccine against COVID-19 based onHAdV26 was authorized for emergency use. Nevertheless, basic biology of thisvirus, namely, pathway which HAdV26 uses to enter the cell, is stillinsufficiently known. We have shown here that HAdV26 infection of humanepithelial cells expressing low amount of alphavbeta3 integrin involves clathrin and is caveolin-1-independent, while HAdV26 infection of cells with high amountof alphavbeta3 integrin does not involve clathrin but is caveolin-1-dependent.Thus, this study demonstrates that caveolin-1 is limiting factor in alphavbeta3integrin-mediated HAdV26 infection. Regardless of alphavbeta3 integrinexpression, HAdV26 infection involves dynamin-2. Our data provide for thefirst-time description of HAdV26 cell entry pathway, hence increase our knowledgeof HAdV26 infection. Knowing that functionality of adenovirus vector isinfluenced by its cell entry pathway and intracellular trafficking, our resultswill contribute to better understanding of HAdV26 immunogenicity and antigenpresentation when used as vaccine vector. IMPORTANCE In order to fulfill its roleas a vector, adenovirus needs to successfully deliver its DNA genome to the host nucleus, a process highly influenced by adenovirus intracellular translocation.Thus, cell entry pathway and intracellular trafficking determine functionality ofhuman adenovirus-based vectors. Endocytosis of HAdV26, currently extensivelystudied as a vaccine vector, has not been described so far. We present here that HAdV26 infection of human epithelial cells with high expression of alphavbeta3integrin, one of the putative HAdV26 receptors, is caveolin-1- and partiallydynamin-2-dependent. Since caveolin containing domains provide a uniqueenvironment for specific signaling events and participate in inflammatorysignaling one can imagine that directing HAdV26 cell entry towardcaveolin-1-mediate pathway might play role in immunogenicity of this virus.Therefore, our results contribute to better understanding of HAdV26 infectionpathway, hence, can be helpful in explaining induction of immune response andantigen presentation by HAdV26-based vaccine vector.

TI  - A SCID Mouse Model To Evaluate the Efficacy of Antivirals against SARS-CoV-2Infection.
PG  - e0075822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00758-22 [doi]
AB  - Ancestral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lacks the intrinsic ability to bind to the mouse ACE2 receptor, and therefore establishmentof SARS-CoV-2 mouse models has been limited to the use of mouse-adapted virusesor genetically modified mice. Interestingly, some of the variants of concern,such as the Beta B.1.351 variant, show an improved binding to the mouse receptor and hence better replication in different wild-type (WT) mouse species. Here, we describe the establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 Beta B.1.351 variant infection modelin male SCID mice as a tool to assess the antiviral efficacy of potentialSARS-CoV-2 small-molecule inhibitors. Intranasal infection of male SCID mice with10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the Beta B.1.351 variantresulted in high viral loads in the lungs and moderate signs of lung pathology onday 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with the antiviral drugsmolnupiravir (200 mg/kg, twice a day [BID]) or nirmatrelvir (300 mg/kg, BID) for 3 consecutive days significantly reduced the infectious virus titers in the lungsby 2 and 3.9 log10 TCID50/mg of tissue, respectively, and significantly improved lung pathology. Together, these data demonstrate the validity of this SCID mouse Beta B.1.351 variant infection model as a convenient preclinical model forassessment of potential activity of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCEUnlike the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, the Beta (B.1.351) variant of concern hasbeen reported to replicate to some extent in WT mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Wedemonstrate here that infection of SCID mice with the Beta variant resulted inhigh viral loads in the lungs on day 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir for 3 consecutive days markedly reduced theinfectious virus titers in the lungs and improved lung pathology. The SARS-CoV2SCID mouse infection model, which is ideally suited for antiviral studies, offersan advantage in comparison to other SARS-CoV2 mouse models, in that there is noneed for the use of mouse-adapted virus strains or genetically modified mice.Mouse models also have advantages over hamster models because (i) lower amountsof test drugs are needed, (ii) more animals can be housed in a cage, and (iii)reagents to analyze mouse samples are more readily available than those forhamsters.

TI  - Structural Study of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Identifies a Broad-Spectrum AntibodyThat Neutralizes the Omicron Variant by Disassembling the Spike Trimer.
PG  - e0048022
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00480-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) variants poses new challenges in the fight against the coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The newly emerging Omicron strain causedserious immune escape and raised unprecedented concern all over the world. Thedevelopment of an antibody targeting a conserved and universal epitope isurgently needed. A subset of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against COVID-19 fromconvalescent patients were isolated in our previous study. In this study, weinvestigated the accommodation of these NAbs to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern(VOCs), revealing that IgG 553-49 neutralizes pseudovirus of the SARS-CoV-2Omicron variant. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy(cryo-EM) structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein complexed with threemonoclonal antibodies targeting different epitopes, including 553-49, 553-15, and553-60. Notably, 553-49 targets a novel conserved epitope and neutralizes thevirus by disassembling S trimers. IgG 553-15, an antibody that neutralizes all ofthe VOCs except Omicron, cross-links two S trimers to form a trimer dimer,demonstrating that 553-15 neutralizes the virus by steric hindrance and virionaggregation. These findings suggest the potential to develop 553-49 and otherantibodies targeting this highly conserved epitope as promising therapeuticreagents for COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The emergence of the Omicron strain ofSARS-CoV-2 caused higher immune escape, raising unprecedented concerns about the effectiveness of antibody therapies and vaccines. In this study, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, 553-49, which neutralizes all variants bytargeting a completely conserved novel epitope. In addition, we revealed that IgG553-15 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by cross-linking virions and that 553-60 functions by blocking receptor binding. Comparison of different receptor binding domain(RBD) epitopes revealed that the 553-49 epitope is hidden in the S trimer andkeeps a high degree of conservation during SARS-CoV-2 evolution, making 553-49 a promising therapeutic reagent against the emerging Omicron and future variants ofSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - During COVID-19, it was critical that services adapted to meet the high demandsof the pandemic. This qualitative study explores the experiences of several staffmembers of the community palliative care team, as they adapted the delivery oftheir services to such pressures. Semi-structured interviews via a virtualplatform were conducted and four themes were identified: service development,communication, inter-professional relationships and support mechanisms. Theparticipants supported the change in service delivery and use of technology totriage patients. The participants also reported improved collaboration andpatient care-coordination, and enhanced support mechanisms used by the teamhelped sustain resilience and wellbeing. Although challenging, the team embraced the changes and described improved collaboration and coordination of patientcare.

TI  - Neutralization Titers in Vaccinated Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Delta BreakthroughInfections.
PG  - e0199622
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01996-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmission andimmune evasion has caused breakthrough infections in the vaccinated population.It is important to determine the threshold of neutralizing antibody titers (NT50)that permit breakthrough infections in humans. Here, we tested the neutralizationtiters of vaccinated patients who contracted Delta variant. All 64 patients with Delta breakthrough infections exhibited NT50 of less than 70. When thebreakthrough sera were tested against USA-WA1/2020 (a strain isolated in lateJanuary 2020), 82.8%, 15.6%, and 1.6% of them had the NT50 ranges of <20, 20 to50, and 50 to 69, respectively. When the same breakthrough sera were testedagainst Delta-spike SARS-CoV-2, 68.7%, 26.6%, and 4.7% of them had the NT50ranges of <20, 20 to 50, and 50 to 69, respectively. Overall, the results suggestNT50 of 70 as a potential neutralizing threshold required to prevent Deltabreakthrough infections. These clinical laboratory results have implications invaccine strategy and public health policy. IMPORTANCE Given that neutralizingantibodies play a key role in protection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is importantto define the neutralization levels in vaccinated individuals when theycontracted breakthrough infections. In this study, we analyzed the neutralizationlevels from 64 vaccinated patients on days 0 to 5 before they tested positive forDelta breakthrough infections. The neutralization titers in these vaccinatedindividuals were all lower than 70 when they contracted breakthrough infections. The results suggest a neutralization titer of 70 as the potential thresholdrequired to prevent breakthrough infections of Delta variant.

PG  - 1349-1357
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2022.2107602 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has become a global pandemic sinceDecember 2019. Most of the patients are mild or asymptomatic and recovered wellas those suffered from other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection issupposed to demonstrate more sequelae. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among COVID-19 patients and is associated with disease severity and outcomes. Only afew studies focused on a detailed analysis of kidney damage in asymptomatic ormildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Whether any minor viral infection is likelyto exhibit similar minor effect on renal function as COVID-19 is still unclear,and the definite pathophysiology of viral invasion is not fully understood.Currently, the proposed mechanisms of AKI include direct effects of virus onkidney, dysregulated immune response, or as a result of multi-organs failure havebeen proposed. This study will discuss the difference between COVID-19 and other viruses, focusing on proposed mechanisms, biomarkers and whether it matters with clinical significance.

TI  - Perception and Learning Satisfaction of Resident Doctors Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: Adaptation Experience at a Virtual Educational Course in Internal Medicine.
PG  - 678-684
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the perception of the significance of the revision course and satisfaction of resident doctors with the West AfricanCollege of Physicians (WACP) revision course in internal medicine. METHODS: This was a post-training evaluation of resident doctors who had enrolled for the 2021 membership revision course in internal medicine between August 9-13, 2021. Datawere collected through an electronic questionnaire composed of five sections:Sociodemographic characteristics, involvement in research, perception on thesignificance/expectations from the course, lessons learnt, and perception of the overall coordination of the revision course/recommendations. Descriptivestatistics were summarized using frequency tables. Chi-square tests wereconducted to determine the association between participants' sociodemographiccharacteristics and satisfaction with the WACP revision course. RESULTS: The meanage (+/-SD) of the 119 resident doctors was 34.30 (+/- 4.81) years and the medianduration (range) of residency training was 7 (4-10) years. All participants were currently in medical practice either in teaching hospitals (104,87.4%) orsecondary health facilities (15, 12.6%). Overall, 108 (90.8%) doctors weresatisfied with the course. Variables that were associated with satisfaction with the WACP revision course included: duration in residency training (doctors thathad spent two years or less in the residency training programme) (Chi-square =21.703, p = <0.001), place of residency training (teaching hospitals) (Chi-square= 67.461, p = <0.001), and participation in research (Chi-square = 47.976, p =<0.001). CONCLUSION: The WACP revision course in internal medicine met itsobjectives. Engagement of resident doctors in research activities should beundertaken intensely.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 vaccine on clinical characteristics and outcome ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients during the fourth wave of the pandemic in TuzlaCanton, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
LID - 10.17392/1500-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To evaluate clinical and epidemiological characteristics and outcome ofpatients with COVID-19, and impact of vaccine against COVID-19 on them. MethodsThis retrospective study included 225 patients treated from COVID-19 in theperiod from 1 to 30 September 2021 at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases,University Clinical Centre Tuzla (UCC Tuzla). For the diagnosis confirmation ofCovid-19, RTPCR was used. Patients were divided in two groups: fully vaccinatedwith two doses of vaccine, and non-vaccinated or partially vaccinated. Results Of225 patients, 120 (53.3%) were females, and 105 (46.7%) males. Mean age was 65.6 years. There were 26 (11.6%) fully vaccinated patients. Most common symptoms inunvaccinated patients were fatigue (70.9%), cough (70.4%) and fever (69.8%), and in vaccinated fever (76.9%), fatigue (69.2%) and cough (46.2%). Cough was morecommon in unvaccinated patients (p=0.013). Fatal outcome happened in 84 (37.3%)patients. Transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and older age had a higherrisk of death (p<0.001). Older age patients were more likely to havecomorbidities like atrial fibrillation (p=0.017), hypertension (p<001) anddiabetes mellitus (p=0.002). Atrial fibrillation (p<0.001), hypertension(p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.009) and history of stroke (p=0.026), wererelated to fatal outcome in unvaccinated patients, also did a shorter duration ofillness prior to hospitalization (p<0.001) and shorter length of hospitalization (p=0.002). Conclusion Older patients with comorbidities, as well as those whowere not vaccinated against COVID-19, were at higher risk for severe form of the disease and poor outcome.

LID - 10.17392/1490-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To investigate the relationship between adherence to preventive behaviors andrisk of COVID-19 infection. Methods In this case-control study, 491 participants were selected through convenience sampling. First, the samples of the case group (COVID-19 patients) were selected, and then the control group was matched withthe case group based on age, gender, and occupation. The criteria for diagnosing COVID-19 for the case group were self-reported positive PCR test or lunginvolvement on a chest CT scan. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize theresults, and an odds ratio was calculated to quantify the magnitude of theassociation using a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p<0.05. Results Theresults showed that, compared to those who always wear a mask, the risk ofcontracting SARS-CoV-2 was 3.153 times higher in those who used no masks (95% CI:0.953-10.434) and 3.779 times higher in those who used masks occasionally (95%CI:1.929-7.37). The participants who never observed physical distancing andhandwashing were 2.25 times more likely to get COVID-19 than those who alwaysobserved (95% CI:1.719-4.954; OR=2.258). Conclusion Participants who fail infollowing the protective measures, especially wearing a mask regardless of itstype, had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is recommended touse a mask consistently, especially during the peak of COVID-19 waves.

TI  - Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor and Venous Thromboembolism inCOVID-19.
PG  - e025198
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.025198 [doi]
AB  - Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) contributes significantly to COVID-19morbidity and mortality. The urokinase receptor system is involved in theregulation of coagulation. Levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activatorreceptor (suPAR) reflect hyperinflammation and are strongly predictive ofoutcomes in COVID-19. Whether suPAR levels identify patients with COVID-19 atrisk for VTE is unclear. Methods and Results We leveraged a multinationalobservational study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with suPAR and D-dimer levels measured on admission. In 1960 patients (mean age, 58 years; 57% men; 20% Black race), we assessed the association between suPAR and incident VTE (defined as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) using logistic regression andFine-Gray modeling, accounting for the competing risk of death. VTE occurred in163 (8%) patients and was associated with higher suPAR and D-dimer levels. There was a positive association between suPAR and D-dimer (beta=7.34; P=0.002).Adjusted for clinical covariables, including D-dimer, the odds of VTE were 168%higher comparing the third with first suPAR tertiles (adjusted odds ratio, 2.68[95% CI, 1.51-4.75]; P<0.001). Findings were consistent when stratified byD-dimer levels and in survival analysis accounting for death as a competing risk.On the basis of predicted probabilities from random forest, a decision tree foundthe combined D-dimer <1 mg/L and suPAR <11 ng/mL cutoffs, identifying 41% ofpatients with only 3.6% VTE probability. Conclusions Higher suPAR was associated with incident VTE independently of D-dimer in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.Combining suPAR and D-dimer identified patients at low VTE risk.

TI  - Biosafety of personnel of microbiological laboratories in the context of theFederal Law of the Russian Federation numero sign 492-FZ of December 30, 2020<<On the biological safety of the Russian Federation>>.
PG  - 414-422

AB  - One of the most important requirements for the personnel of microbiologicallaboratories working with pathogenic and infectious agents is the observance ofprecautionary measures and the implementation of a set of preventive measures,collectively interpreted as biological safety (biosafety). To a large extent,biosafety problems are also relevant for all clinical laboratories working withbiosubstrates, with the potential threat of containing pathogens of bloodborneinfections in them. On December 30, 2020, the President of the Russian Federationsigned Federal Law numero sign 492 <<On the Biological Safety of the RussianFederation>> (numero sign 492-FZ), which regulates the basic legal norms andregulation of biosafety issues, as well as a list of measures to prevent therisks of the spread of infections due to accidents, bioterrorist acts andsabotage. The current pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 hasdemonstrated, on the one hand, the epidemiological vulnerability of the singleworld space, and on the other hand, the decisive influence of biologicalemergencies on the emergence of negative political and economic processes in the world community. In this regard, the issues of ensuring biosafety in the work of microbiological laboratories in the context of protecting personnel and theenvironment from accidental or unintentional spread of infections are relevant.Working with pathogenic biological agents in microbiological laboratories isconstantly associated with the risk of accidents and possible laboratoryinfection (laboratory-acquired infections) of employees, environmental pollution if the requirements of regulatory documents on biological safety are not met. In accordance with the requirements of numero sign 492-FZ, in order to preventbiological threats, it is necessary to create a system for monitoring biological risks in microbiological laboratories when working with any infected material.

AB  - As of May 17, 2022, more than a million deaths due to COVID-19 have been recordedin the US. For each COVID-19 death, there are an estimated nine bereaved familymembers and an unknown number of bereaved friends. This study aimed to assess thecorrelates of self-reported COVID-19 death exposure (i.e., loss of a close friendor family member) among US adults using online survey data (n = 1,869) collected between September 17, 2021 and October 3, 2021. One in four US adults in thisnational sample reported the loss of a close friend or family member due toCOVID-19. The odds of losing a close friend or family member due to COVID-19death were greater for those age 60 or older, all minoritized racial/ethnicgroups except for Asian American respondents, married/coupled respondents, those who had foregone care due to cost in the past year, and those who reported aCOVID-19 infection.

LID - 10.1017/S1463423622000391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led tosignificant re-organisation of general practice in the United Kingdom and around the world. The general practice workforce has led changes to their services,often dealing with high levels of uncertainty. The way in which manypractitioners consult has shifted significantly, and there has been an increasein the number of phone and online consultations. We know very little about howthose working in general practice experienced the service reorganisationintroduced in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: The aim of thisproject was to describe the changes in the delivery of general practice in theUnited Kingdom in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, toexplore primary care practitioners' and managers' experiences of change withingeneral practice during this time and investigate shifts in perceptions ofprofessional identities. METHOD: We conducted a longitudinal qualitative studythat captured narrative accounts from 17 primary care practitioners and managers across England and Scotland. Each participant submitted narrative accounts in thefirst year of the COVID-19 pandemic using self-recorded or written contributions,or via an interview if preferred. These were analysed using a grounded theoryapproach, with thematic coding used to construct common themes. FINDINGS:Participants' narratives describe the challenges COVID-19 presented to generalpractice. Responses mirror the shifts in the pandemic and its management - froman initial sense of autonomy but uncertainty, to a period of stability andpatients' increasing frustration. The re-organisation of general practice hasaffected practitioners' views of their work and their role as clinicians.Participants' narratives were framed profoundly by the importance of theirrelationships with patients. This analysis of practitioners' and managers'narratives highlights the need for further exploration of how to support thegeneral practice workforce's well-being longer term in a context of increaseddemand and significant change.

TI  - Investigating Organizational Learning and Adaptations for Improved DisasterResponse Towards "Resilient Hospitals:" An Integrative Literature Review.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1017/S1049023X2200108X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For hospitals, learning from disaster response efforts and adaptingorganizational practices can improve resilience in dealing with futuredisruptions. However, amidst global disruptions by climate change, thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and other disasters, hospitals'ability to cope continues to be highly variable. Hence, there are increasingcalls to improve hospitals' capabilities to grow and adapt towards enhancedresilience. AIM: This study aims two-fold: (1) to characterize the current state of knowledge about how hospitals are gaining knowledge from their responses todisasters, and (2) to explore how this knowledge can be applied to informorganizational practices for hospital resilience. METHOD: This study usedPreferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)guidelines for data collection and framework for data analysis, Covidencesoftware, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords relevant to"hospitals," "learn," "disaster response," and "resilience." The qualityappraisal used an adapted version of the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT).RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality appraisal,out of the 420 articles retrieved, 22 articles remained for thematic and content analysis. The thematic analysis included the hospital's functional (operational) and physical (structural and non-structural) sections. The content analysisfollowed nine learning areas (Governance and Leadership, Planning and RiskAssessment, Surveillance and Monitoring, Communication and Network Engagement,Staff Practices and Safety, Equipment and Resources, Facilities andInfrastructure, Novelty and Innovation, and Learning and Evaluation).On applying the Deming cycle, only four studies described a completed learning cycle wherein hospitals adapted their organizational structures using the prior experience and evaluation gained in responding to disaster(s). CONCLUSIONS: There is a gapbetween hospitals' organizational learning and institutionalized practice. Theconceptualized Hybrid Resilience Learning Framework (HRLF) aims to guide thehospitals' decision makers in evaluating organizational resilience andknowledge.In the face of disasters, both the stressful factors and the copingstrategies that affect the health care workers (HCWs) should be substantiallyconsidered.

TI  - Humoral and cellular response of COVID-19 vaccine among solid organ transplantrecipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/tid.13926 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyze the humoral and cellular response to standard andbooster (additional doses) COVID-19 vaccination in solid organ transplantation(SOT) and the risk factors involved for an impaired response. METHODS: We did asystematic review and meta-analysis of studies published up until January 11,2022, that reported immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine among SOT. The study isregistered with PROSPERO, number CRD42022300547 RESULTS: : Of the 1527 studies,112 studies which involved 15391 SOT and 2844 healthy controls were included. SOTshowed a low humoral response [effect size (ES): 0.44(0.40-0.48)] in overall and in control studies [log-Odds-ratio (OR): -4.46 (-8.10 to -2.35)]. The humoralresponse was highest in liver [ES: 0.67(0.61-0.74)] followed by heart [ES:0.45(0.32-0.59)], kidney [ES: 0.40(0.36-0.45)], kidney-pancreas [ES: 0.33(0.13 - 0.53)], and lung [0.27(0.17-0.37)]. The meta-analysis for standard and boosterdose [ES: 0.43(0.39-0.47) versus 0.51(0.43-0.54)] showed a marginal increase of18% efficacy. SOT with prior infection had higher response [ES: 0.94(0.92- 0.96) vs ES: 0.40(0.39-0.41); p-value < 0.01). The seroresponse with mRNA-12723 mRNAwas highest 0.52(0.40-0.64). Mycophenolic acid [OR: 1.42 (1.21 to 1.63)] andBelatacept [OR: 1.89 (1.3 to 2.49)] had highest risk for non-response. SOT had a parallelly decreased cellular response [ES: 0.42(0.32-0.52)] in overall andcontrol studies [OR: -3.12(-0.4.12 to -2.13)] INTERPRETATION: Overall, SOTdevelops a suboptimal response compared to the general population.Immunosuppression including mycophenolic acid, belatacept, and tacrolimus isassociated with decreased response. Booster doses increase the immune response,but further up-gradation in vaccination strategy for SOT is required. Thisarticle is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future pandemics.
LID - 10.1080/14760584.2022.2110075 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vaccination continues to be the most effective method forcontrolling COVID-19 infectious diseases. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 variantscontinue to evolve and emerge, resulting in significant public concerns worldwideeven after more than two years since the COVID-19 pandemic. It is significant to better understand how different COVID-19 vaccine platforms work, why SARS-CoV-2variants continue to emerge, and what options for improving COVID-19 vaccines canbe considered to fight against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future pandemics. AREACOVERED: Here, we reviewed the innate immune sensors in the recognition ofSARS-CoV-2 virus, innate and adaptive immunity including neutralizing antibodies by different COVID-19 vaccines. Efficacy comparison of the several COVID-19vaccine platforms approved to use in humans, concerns about SARS-CoV-2 variantsand breakthrough infections, and the options for developing future COIVD-19vaccines were also covered. EXPERT OPINION: Owing to the continuous emergence of novel pathogens and the re-emergence of variants, safer and more effective newvaccines are needed. This review is also aimed to provide the knowledge basis forthe development of next-generation COVID-19 and pan-coronavirus vaccines toprovide cross-protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants and future coronaviruspandemics.

TI  - Acute kidney injury and its association with mortality in Asian COVID-19patients: A meta-analysis.
LID - 10.5414/CN110899 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonin patients with COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. Moreover, theincidence and mortality of AKI in Asia are ambiguous. OBJECTIVE: Evaluating therisk factors and risk of death from AKI in COVID-19 patients in Asia. MATERIALSAND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical observational studies ofCOVID-19 patients in Asia. Outcome measures included: AKI in COVID-19 patients,overall mortality in COVID-19 patients, and mortality assessment in patients withAKI. The random-effects model was adopted, with heterogeneity and sensitivityanalysis. RESULTS: 27 clinical studies (18,216 Asian patients with COVID-19) havebeen included in the study. The pooled incidence of AKI was 0.19 (95% CI 16 -23%; I2 = 98.9%, p < 0.001); the pooled incidence of total mortality was 0.19(95% CI 17 - 22%; I2 = 98.9%, p < 0.001). No publication bias was found (Egger's test, p = 0.396, 0.213). The pooled mortality in AKI patients with COVID-19 was50% (95% CI 33 - 67%; I2 by random-effects model = 98.4%, p < 0.001). AKI wasfound to be a risk factor for death in stepwise regression analysis; age,diabetes, and hypertension were influencing factors for AKI risk in COVID-19patients. CONCLUSION: AKI is a common complication in Asian COVID-19 patients,and it is associated with an increase in mortality of Asian COVID-19 patients.Any treatment that protects the kidney may be a practical intervention to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients in Asia.

TI  - Use of synchronous kidney and lung extracorporeal support for severe COVID-19: A single-center retrospective study.
LID - 10.5414/CN110793 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with both kidney and respiratory failure.During the early phase of the coronavirus disease pandemic, patients oftenrequired the use of mechanical assistance to provide adequate kidney and lungfunction. In this paper we describe the clinical outcomes of patients whorequired synchronous kidney and lung extracorporeal support for COVID-19.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients admitted to Baylor University Medical Center,Dallas, between February 1, 2020, to April 23, 2021, with COVID-19 who requiredboth extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who were on hemo- orperitoneal dialysis prior to admission or who required veno-arterial (VA) ECMOwere excluded. RESULTS: 35 patients with COVID-19 required ECMO and CRRT support.Four patients (11%) were excluded, 2 due to being on dialysis prior to admission and 2 due to the requirement of VA-ECMO. The median time on CRRT was 33 days (IQR13 - 51). The median time on ECMO was 28 days (IQR 10.5 - 59.5). At 90 days, 9patients had died (29%), 4 patients remained hospitalized, and 18 patients hadbeen discharged: 10 to long-term acute care, 2 to inpatient rehabilitation, and 6to home. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 requiring concurrent ECMO and CRRT in this institution had a 29% mortality at 90 days.

TI  - Assessing the Fit of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Fitted with an Ear Loop Strap System: A Pilot Study.

LID - 10.1093/annweh/wxac051 [doi]
AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of millions of people worldwide havebecome new users of respiratory protective devices. Facemasks and KN95respirators utilizing an ear loop straps system (ELSS) have recently becomepopular among occupational and non-occupational populations. Part of thispopularity is due to the ease of wearability as compared with traditional devicesutilizing two headbands, one worn over the head and the other behind the neck-auniversal strap system used in NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepiecerespirators (FFRs). Some users convert the two-strap configuration to anadjustable ELSS. The first objective of this pilot study was to quantitativelycharacterize how such a conversion impacts the respirator fit. Additionally, anovel faceseal (NFS) technology, which has been previously demonstrated toenhance the fit of N95 FFRs, was deployed to modify the ELSS-converted N95 FFRs. The second objective of this study was to quantify the fit improvement thatresults from adding the NFS to the ELSS. The study was conducted by performingthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-approved quantitativefit testing (QNFT) on 16 human subjects featuring different facial shapes anddimensions. Three models of cup-shaped N95 FFRs were tested in three versions:the standard version with manufacturer's strap system, the ELSS-converted, andthe ELSS-converted version modified by adding the NFS. QNFT demonstrated that thefit of an N95 FFR featuring the traditional/standard headbands strap system isnegatively impacted when this system is converted to an ELSS. The fit of anELSS-converted respirator can be significantly improved by the addition of theNFS. We found that the FFR model and the strap system version are significantfactors affecting the QNFT-determined respirator fit factor (FF), as well as the OSHA QNFT pass rate (FF >/=100). The findings suggest that the current NFS, iffurther improved, has a potential for developing a 'universally fitting'ELSS-equipped N95 FFR that can be used by the general public, the vast majorityof whom do not have access to OSHA fit requirements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa is aiming to achieve herd immunity against thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the first quarter of 2022. The success of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out depends primarily on the willingness of thepopulation to take the vaccines. AIM: This study aimed to examine the willingnessto take the COVID-19 vaccine, along with the factors of concern, efficacy andpreferences of the individual, which may increase the willingness to bevaccinated. SETTING: This study was conducted at the University of theWitwatersrand, Johannesburg, amongst adult students and academic and professionalstaff. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey from 27 July 2021 to 14 August2021 was conducted. We performed descriptive and inferential analysis todetermine the factors associated with willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine.RESULTS: A total of 2364 participants responded to a survey link and 82.0% werestudents, 66.8% were in the 18-29 years age band and females represented 64.0%. Atotal of 1965 participants (83.3%) were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine,the most preferred vaccines were Pfizer (41%) and JJ (23%), local pharmacy (29%) and General Practitioner (GP) (17%) were the preferred places for vaccination andthe trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were the generalpractitioners (40.6%) and specialists (19.2%). Perceptions that vaccines are safe(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 31.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.02-62.12 foraffirmative agreement) and effective (aOR = 5.92, 95% CI: 2.87-12.19 foraffirmative agreement) were the main determinants of willingness to taking aCOVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: It is imperative to reinforce the message ofCOVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy and to include the GPs and the communitypharmacies in the vaccination roll-out in South Africa.

PG  - e1-e8
LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in early2020, the unemployment rate in South Africa was at its highest in history at29.1%. During the COVID-19 pandemic to date, unemployment rose even higher to35.3%. In this context, there has been an increase in the number of unemployedhealth professionals in South Africa. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determinethe employment rates of newly graduated South African audiologists and identifythe challenges in obtaining and maintaining employment for audiologists in South Africa. METHODS: A descriptive online survey design was used. Participants wererecruited online through professional association webpages using the snowballsampling technique. All qualified audiologists registered with the HealthProfessionals Council of South Africa were eligible to participate. RESULTS: Atotal of 132 audiologists completed the survey. In the first-year postgraduation,16% of the participants were unemployed, and this increased to 19% in thesecond-year postgraduation. In the majority (81%) of employed participants,almost a fifth (19%) were working within non-audiology/healthcare fields. Themost common workplace challenges reported were remuneration (37%) followed bylack of resources (18%), workload (18%), work environment (10%), working hours(9%) and, lastly, interprofessional relationships (8%). CONCLUSION: Findings fromthis study are the first to document employment rates amongst South Africanaudiologists. These findings have the potential to influence the criticaldiscourse on hearing healthcare human resource planning, hearing healthcarelabour capacity and potential for growth in the South African contextpost-COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the learning experiences of first-year speech-language pathology (SLP) students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is essential to ensure that academic staff are able to support and enhance thetransition from secondary to tertiary education. An understanding of the student experience could lead to improved support strategies that could be beneficial forthe blended learning environment that the University of the Witwatersrand will beentering from 2022. OBJECTIVES: This research explored the experiences offirst-year SLP students in online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An exploratory mixed-method concurrent triangulation design was employed.Quantitative data were collected from likert scales. Qualitative data werecollected from critical incident timelines. Themes were identified from both the Likert scales as well as the critical incident timelines using bottom-up thematicanalysis. RESULTS: The majority of participants reflected that their onlinelearning through the pandemic in 2021 was successful. The themes that emergedfrom this year pertain to 2021 and the specific participants however, it providesan important insight that the students' needs change during a year. As alecturer, one needs to consider these evolving needs to ensure students have the support that they require to be successful in their learning. CONCLUSION: Thisresearch provided insights into the evolving nature of the support first-year SLPstudents require in the online learning space during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Health sciences students' perception of the communicative impacts of facecoverings during the COVID-19 pandemic at a South African University.
PG  - e1-e14
LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of face masks and/or shields can pose a challenge duringcommunication. They block facial expressions thus removing visual cues and affectsound transmission making it difficult to hear speech clearly. Given thewidespread use of face coverings, it seems reasonable to clarify if communicationin typical speakers and listeners has significantly differed. Health sciencestudents as future practitioners need to understand challenges that arise fromusing face coverings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine health sciencesstudents' perception of the communicative impacts of face coverings. METHOD: The study employed a descriptive, self-administered online survey, obtaininginformation from 96 health science undergraduate students. RESULTS: Allparticipants changed their manner of speaking in that they spoke louder whenwearing masks and focused more on eye contact when someone was wearing masks.These were statistically significant (p = 0.450 and p = 0.035 respectively).Fifty-three percent reported using more listening effort and feeling anxious whencommunicating. Approximately 33% indicated that it was challenging to reademotions, such as sad or unhappy, when someone wore a mask. Most, 61%, werepositive or very positive about wearing masks. The level of difficulty differeddepending on the listening environment. It was harder to understand the doctor,nurse, or other healthcare workers when they wore face coverings than whenlistening to their friends and family, which had little effect, this beingstatistically significant (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Challenges envisaged inpractice included frequent communication breakdowns, inability to connect andbuild trust between patient and practitioner, and communicating in noisyenvironments. Coping strategies, future clinical and research implications wereproposed, and limitations acknowledged.

PG  - e1-e7
LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.910 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the latest publichealth emergency that has presented challenges globally. Limited evidence exists on the association between COVID-19 and middle ear pathologies, regardless of therespiratory nature of some of the core symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This scoping reviewaimed at exploring evidence on the effects of COVID-19 on middle ear functioning as part of symptom mapping and preventive planning for ear and hearing care.METHOD: Electronic bibliographic databases, including Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Science Direct, ERIC and Scopus, were searched to identify peer reviewedpublications, published in English, between December 2019 and January 2022,related to the effects of COVID-19 on middle ear functioning. The keywords usedas MeSH terms included 'middle ear pathology', 'middle ear disorder', 'otitismedia', 'hearing loss', 'hearing impairment', 'audiology' and 'COVID-19' or'coronavirus'. RESULTS: From eight studies that met the inclusion criteria, thefindings revealed that middle ear pathologies occur in this population, with the occurrence ranging from 1.15% to 75%. Tympanic membrane structural changes,otitis media and conductive hearing loss (CHL) were commonly reported. Thecurrent findings must be interpreted with caution given that most of the studies reviewed had extremely small sample sizes or were case studies or series, thuslimiting generalisability. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the value ofstrategic research planning to collate data during pandemics, ensuring thatfuture studies use appropriate and well-designed methodologies. Trends andpatterns of middle ear pathologies in this population must also be established todetermine the need for periodic monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa's healthcare system has a multitude of pre-existingchallenges prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic, ranging from reduced number of staff, lack of resources and units beingat overcapacity both in the adult and paediatric populations. The neonatalintensive care units (NICUs) require a team approach to ensure best practice withvulnerable infants, but little is known about how the onset of the COVID-19pandemic and the resultant lockdown restrictions impacted the feeding practiceswithin the NICU. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the impact that COVID-19had on the feeding practices within the NICU settings in public hospitals inGauteng. METHODS: A qualitative design was employed with data collected in twoNICUs in Gauteng. Data were collected in the form of observations andsemi-structured interviews with healthcare workers (HCWs) in the NICU. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although the sample size of participants was limited, social distancing proved to be a challenge resulting inmothers and healthcare workers being given restricted access. This had effects onthe ability to provide adequate feeding practices and resulted in anxiety for themothers and mental health challenges for the HCWs when feeding these at-riskinfants. A limitation of this study was the use of only two sites. CONCLUSION:COVID-19 amplified the existing challenges in the NICU. A multidisciplinary andfamily-centred approach to address feeding challenges is required to offset thechallenges resulting from the pandemic and subsequent lockdown.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented and highlighted newand unanticipated challenges to the provision of clinical services, raising anurgency for the application of different models of service delivery, includingtele-audiology. In many tele-audiology encounters, a site facilitator is neededat the patient site to help with the hands-on aspects of procedures, and theimplications of this requirement are significant for the resource-constrainedAfrican context. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this scoping review was to investigatepublished evidence on training provided to patient site facilitators (PSFs) fortele-audiology application to guide the South African audiology community intele-audiology application initiatives. METHOD: Electronic bibliographicdatabases including Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus MEDLINE and ProQuest weresearched to identify peer-reviewed publications, published in English, between2017 and 2021 related to training of PSFs. The guidelines of the PreferredReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) were followedduring the screening process as well as for illustrating the process. RESULTS:Findings are discussed under four key themes: (1) type of tele-audiology and the implications thereof, (2) length of training and its implications, (3) diversity in the range of PSFs used and its implications for the training, and (4)heterogeneity in the training. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight importantconsiderations for tele-audiology application within the African context,specifically decision-making around who can serve in the role of PSFs, as well ascontent and nature of training required, with implications for policy andregulations as well as human resource strategy. These findings are important for the COVID-19 pandemic era and beyond.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented new andunanticipated challenges to the academic training and performance of clinicalresearch at undergraduate and postgraduate levels of training. This highlightedthe need for reimagining research designs and methods to ensure continuedgeneration of knowledge - a core function of a research-intensive university.Whilst adhering to government regulations geared towards protecting both theresearch participants and researchers, innovative research methods are required. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review is to explore published evidence oninnovative clinical research methods and processes employed during COVID-19 andto document challenges encountered and lessons that the fields of Speech-LanguagePathology and Audiology can learn. METHODS: Electronic bibliographic databasesincluding Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, ProQuest were searched toidentify peer-reviewed publications, published in English, between 2019 and 2021,related to innovative clinical research methods and processes applied wherein-person contact is regulated. RESULTS: Significant challenges with conductingresearch in the COVID-19 era were identified, with important lessons learned and numerous opportunities that have relevance for this pandemic era and beyond.These findings are presented under 10 themes that emerged that highlightimportant considerations for research methods and processes during a pandemic andbeyond. The findings of this study also raise implications for telehealth fromwhich low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resource challenges exist, can benefit. CONCLUSION: Challenges and opportunities identified in this reviewhave relevance for the field of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology as far ascurrent and future (beyond COVID-19) clinical research planning is concerned.

LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.212 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to examine how public health policies influenced thedynamics of COVID-19 time-varying reproductive number (R t ) in South Carolinafrom February 26, 2020 to January 1, 2021. METHODS: COVID-19 case series (March6, 2020 - January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 days to approximate the infectiondate. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on R t using EpiEstim.We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case countvaries across counties with different population size. RESULTS: R t shifted from 2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. R t rose over the summer and stayedbetween 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associatedwith a decline in R t (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening,an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%). Less densely populated counties hadhigher attack rate (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The R t dynamics over time indicatedthat public health interventions substantially slowed COVID-19 transmission inSouth Carolina, while their relaxation may have promoted further transmission.Policies encouraging people to stay home, such as closing non-essentialbusinesses, were associated with R t reduction, while policies that encouragedmore movement, such as re-opening schools, were associated with R t increase.

TI  - Can we use temperature measurements to identify pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2infection in nursing home residents?
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17972 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a severe impact on morbidity and mortality amongnursing home (NH) residents. Earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 may position us tobetter mitigate the risk of spread. Both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatictransmission are common in outbreaks, and threshold temperatures, such as 38C,for screening for infection could miss timely detection in the majority ofresidents. We hypothesized that in long-term care residents, temperature trendswith SARS-CoV-2 infection could identify infection in pre-symptomatic individualsearlier than standard screening. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohortstudy using electronic health records in 6176 residents of the VA NHs whounderwent SARS-CoV-2 testing triggered by symptoms. We collected informationabout age and other demographics, baseline temperature, and specificcomorbidities. We created standardized definitions, and a hypothetical model totest measures of temperature variation and compare outcomes to the VA standard ofcare. RESULTS: We showed that a change from baseline of 0.4C identified 47% of NHresidents who became SARS-CoV-2 positive, earlier than standard testing by anaverage of 42.2 h. Temperature variability of 0.5C over 3 days when paired with a37.2C temperature cutoff identified 55% of NH residents who became SARS-CoV-2positive earlier than the standard of care testing by an average of 44.4 h. Achange from baseline temperature of 0.4C when combined with temperaturevariability of 0.7C over 3 days identified 52% of NH residents who becameSARS-CoV-2 positive, earlier than standard testing by an average of 40 h, and by more than 3 days in 22% of the residents. This earlier detection comes at theexpense of triggering 57,793 tests, as compared to the number of trigger testsordered in the VA system of 40,691. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that earlytemperature trends with SARS-CoV-2 infection may identify infection inpre-symptomatic long-term care residents.

AB  - Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS) may exhibit pulmonary fibrosis after the viral illnessresolves. Some of these patients may experience severe functional lungimpairment, and thus require transplants to prevent death or maintain a tolerablequality of life. Considering the reversibility of COVID-19 ARDS, lung transplant candidates are observed for 1-2 months and must be selected very carefully beforetransplantation. As the short-term outcomes of such patients are comparable tothose of patients with other indications for transplantation, lungtransplantation should be actively considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the changes of clinical characteristics and immune-related indicators of patients with mild and moderate acute Omicron variant infection,and to evaluate the protective effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)vaccination. METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the clinicalcharacteristics of 317 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 Omicron variant(B1.1.529) infection admitted to Tianjin First Central Hospital (Shuixi District)from January 22, 2022 to February 24, 2022. Demographic characteristics,vaccination status, underlying diseases, epidemiological characteristics,baseline data, and relevant laboratory test results on admission were collected, and the differences in clinical characteristics, especially the changes inimmune-related indicators, between mild and moderate patients were compared andanalyzed. RESULTS: Among the 317 adult patients with acute Omicron variantinfection, the proportion of elderly, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases were significantly higher in moderate group (203cases) than those of mild group (114 cases) [age >/= 60 years old: 27.58%(56/203) vs. 9.65% (11/114), hypertension: 31.03% (63/203) vs. 19.30% (22/114),diabetes: 15.76% (32/203) vs. 7.89% (9/114), cardiovascular and cerebrovasculardiseases: 11.33% (23/203) vs 0.88% (1/114), all P < 0.05]. The route oftransmission was mainly through gatherings and the first symptoms were fever, drycough, fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose and other flu symptoms;19.30% (22/114) and 24.63% (50/203) of patients in mild and moderate groups were positive for the new coronavirus nucleic acid test, respectively, but thedifference was not significant difference (P > 0.05). Inflammatory indicators in most mild and moderate patients were within normal range, such as white bloodcell count (WBC), neutrophil ratio (NEU%), lymphocyte count (LYM), C-reactiveprotein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), etc., suggestingthat the acute phase of Omicron variant infection had not yet caused severeinflammatory storm, which might be related to the weakening of pathogenicityafter vaccination and virus mutation. The proportion of patients with IL-6 > 7ng/L in the mild group was significantly lower than that in the normal group[1.75% (2/114) vs. 6.40% (13/203), P < 0.05], suggesting that elevated IL-6 mightbe an important factor in evaluating indicators of disease severity. There was nosignificant difference in lymphocyte subsets between the two groups, but therewere 12.90% (12/93) and 11.04% (17/154) of the patients in two groups,respectively, decreased in the proportion of helper T cells, and 18.28% (17/93)and 14.28% (22/154) of the patients had elevated CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, suggesting that patients with Omicron variant infection had autoimmune system dysfunction,which might be related to disease progression and the occurrence of long-termautoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-6 level may be used as a predictor for evaluating the severity of disease in patients with Omicron variant infection;after vaccination, inflammatory indicators in patients with acute Omicron variantinfection were significantly reduced, but the long-term effects still requirelong-term follow-up observation.

Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for common COVID-19and had risk factors for developing severe disease or had pulse oxygen saturation(SpO2) </= 0.93 after exercise without supplementary oxygen were enrolled.Patients were divided into APP group and control group according to whether they completed the daily 12-hours APP in the first three days after enrollment.Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, COVID-19 vaccination status,laboratory examination, disease progression (progression to severe), time tonucleic acid negative conversion, length of hospital stay, and adverse reactions and tolerability [visual analog scale (VAS) score (the higher the score, theworse the tolerability] during APP were evaluated in two groups. Interleukin-6(IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), SpO2/inhaled oxygen concentration (FiO2) ratio and ROX index (ROXI) were compared between two groups at enrollment, 3rd and 7th day after enrollment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences indemographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, vaccination rates of COVID-19 andlaboratory tests between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between two groups at the timeof enrollment. Compared with the group at the time of enrollment, SpO2/FiO2 ratioand ROXI in APP group increased significantly at the 3rd day after enrollment[SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90 (457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (437.14, 457.10), ROXI:25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs. 22.57 (21.86, 24.40), all P < 0.05], and the levels ofIL-6 and CRP in control group were significantly increased [IL-6 (ng/L): 18.30(6.50, 37.75) vs. 7.40 (5.10, 11.15), CRP (mg/L): 11.46 (2.11, 17.96) vs. 4.11(1.72, 9.05), all P < 0.05]. At the 3rd day of enrollment, the levels of IL-6 andCRP in APP group were significantly lower than those in control group [IL-6(ng/L): 7.35 (4.35, 12.80) vs. 18.30 (6.50, 37.75), CRP (mg/L): 4.52 (1.98, 9.66)vs. 11.46 (2.11, 17.96), all P < 0.05], while SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI weresignificantly higher than those in control group [SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90(457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (441.90, 459.52), ROXI: 25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs.23.31 (22.10, 24.66), all P < 0.05]. At the 7th day of enrollment,there were nosignificant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between twogroups. There were no severe cases in both groups. The time of nucleic acidnegative conversion and length of hospital stay in APP group were significantlyshorter than those in control group [10.0 (8.0, 12.0) days vs. 11.0 (9.0, 13.0)days, 12.0 (10.0, 14.0) days vs. 14.0 (12.0,16.0) days, respectively, all P <0.05]. The main adverse reaction during APP was back pain, and the incidence inAPP group was slightly lower than that in control group, but the difference wasnot statistically significant [17.9% (17/95) vs. 26.5% (27/102), P = 0.149]. VAS score in control group was significantly higher than that in APP group [score:2.5 (2.0, 4.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: In common COVID-19patients caused by Omicron variant with high risk factors for progression tosevere disease or decreased oxygen reserve capacity, early APP can shorten thetime of nucleic acid negative conversion and the length of hospital stay, but itseffect on preventing disease progression cannot be determined.

AB  - Purpose: COVID-19, a novel infection, presented with several complications,including socioeconomical and reproductive health challenges such as erectiledysfunction (ED). The present review summarizes the available shreds of evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on ED.Materials and methods: All publishedpeer-reviewed articles from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to date, relating to ED, were reviewed. Results: Available pieces of evidence that ED is aconsequence of COVID-19 are convincing. COVID-19 and ED share common risk factorssuch as disruption of vascular integrity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cytokine storm, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). COVID-19 also inducesimpaired pulmonary haemodynamics, increased ang II, testicular damage and lowserum testosterone, and reduced arginine-dependent NO bioavailability thatpromotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endothelial dysfunction,resulting in ED. In addition, COVID-19 triggers psychological/mental stress andsuppresses testosterone-dependent dopamine concentration, which contributes toincident ED.Conclusions: In conclusion, COVID-19 exerts a detrimental effect onmale reproductive function, including erectile function. This involves a cascade of events from multiple pathways. As the pandemic dwindles, identifying thelong-term effects of COVID-19-induced ED, and proffering adequate and effectivemeasures in militating against COVID-19-induced ED remains pertinent.

TI  - Effects of boosted mRNA and adenoviral-vectored vaccines on immune responses toomicron BA.1 and BA.2 following the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 vaccination.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28044 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 omicron variant has surged rapidly and raises concerns about immune evasion even in individuals with complete vaccinationbecause it harbors mutations. Here, we examine the capability of boostervaccination following CoronaVac/AZD1222 prime to induce neutralizing antibodies(NAbs) against omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) and T-cell responses. METHODS: A total of 167 participants primed with heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 for 4-5 months wereenrolled to receive AZD1222, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 as a third dose.Reactogenicity was recorded. Immunogenicity analyses of SARS-CoV-2 bindingantibodies were measured using ELISA. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) titersagainst omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were determined using the focus reductionneutralization test (FRNT50) and total interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responseswere measured to observe the T cell activation. RESULTS: A substantial loss inneutralizing potency to omicron variant was found at 4 to 5 months afterreceiving the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222. Following booster vaccination, asignificant increase in binding antibodies and neutralizing activities towarddelta and omicron variants was observed. Neutralization to omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were comparable, showing the highest titers after boosted mRNA-1273 followed byBNT162b2 and AZD1222. In addition, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines developa T cell response to spike protein while those boosted with AZD1222 did not.Reactogenicity was mild to moderate without serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that mRNA booster vaccination is able to overcomewaning immunity to provide antibodies that neutralize omicron BA.1 and BA.2, aswell as a T cell response.

LID - 10.2217/fmb-2022-0006 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationshipbetween lung involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and antibody levels of COVID-19 patients 3and 6 months from the disease. Methods: A total of 156 participants were divided into two groups, Group 1: lung involvement (LI)-positive and Group 2:LI-negative. Biochemical parameters and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were measured. Results: The results showed that mean levels of urea, LDH, CRP,ferritin, neutrophil count and D-dimer were significantly higher in theLI-positive group. In addition, mean antibody levels in the 3rd and 6th monthswere higher in the LI-positive group (p < 0.005). Discussion: High antibodylevels in LI-positive patients correlated with some immunologic and biochemicalparameters. Further studies should be performed to determine protective antibody levels against reinfection, how long protective titers last and the mechanisms bywhich COVID-19 symptoms, demographics and comorbidities may drive higher antibodylevels.

LID - 10.1093/jpids/piac068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent COVID-19 surges are attributed to emergence of moretransmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). The relative severity ofVOCs in children is unknown. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of children </=18 years old diagnosed with COVID-19 from October2020-February 2022 and whose SARS-CoV-2 isolate underwent Illumina sequencing. Wemeasured the frequency of five markers of COVID-19 severity. Logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the odds of each severity marker with each VOC.RESULTS: Among 714 children, 471 (66.0%) were infected with a VOC: 96 (13.4%)alpha, 38 (5.3%) gamma, 119 (16.7%) delta, and 215 (30.1%) omicron. High-riskmedical conditions and increasing age were independently associated with COVID-19severity. After adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, high-risk medical conditions,and COVID-19 community incidence, neither alpha, delta, nor omicron wasassociated with severe COVID-19. Gamma was independently associated withhospitalization (OR 6.7, 95% CI 2.0-22.1); pharmacologic treatment (OR 5.7, 95%CI 1.2-26.8); respiratory support (OR 11.9, 95% CI 2.7-62.4); and severe disease per the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (OR 11.7, 95% CI 2.1-90.5). Upon subgroup analyses, omicron was independently associated with ICU admission and severedisease per the WHO Clinical Progression Scale in children without SARS-CoV-2immunization or prior COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-VOCCOVID-19, the gamma VOC was independently associated with increased COVID-19severity, as was omicron in children without SARS-CoV-2 immunization or priorCOVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and prior COVID-19 prevented severeoutcomes during the omicron surge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: obesity is a risk factor for various diseases and can affect thedisease course. Studies have shown detrimental effects of obesity on patientsaffected with SARS-CoV-2 including increased hospitalization and more severedisease. This study aims to investigate effects of obesity on symptom duration inpatients with COVID-19 and investigate possibility of using BMI as a predictor ofsymptom duration in outpatient settings. METHODS: patients diagnosed withCOVID-19 between June and October 2020 who had no other comorbidities and wereplanned to receive treatment in the outpatient setting were enrolled in thestudy. Duration of the symptoms was determined based on participants' self-reportof their symptoms. Linear regression was used to create predictive models basedon participants' BMI, age, sex, disease presentation, and their self-reportedsymptom duration. RESULTS: 210 patients were included in the final analysis.Patients with higher BMI had significantly longer symptom duration. Linearregression models showed highest correlation between BMI and symptom durationcompared to other covariates. CONCLUSION: low error in predictions and highcoverage of data variability showed BMI can be used as a predictive factor forsymptom duration in COVID-19 patients treated in outpatient settings.

TI  - What happens post-lockdown for people with disability? Autonomy, quality of life,service access and health changes for people with spinal cord injury in Victoria,Australia after COVID-19 social distancing restrictions.
LID - 10.1111/hsc.13958 [doi]
AB  - Social distancing restrictions are undoubtedly important for controlling thespread of COVID-19 however, they are also adversely impacting population healthand health service access. It is important that priority populations with adisability which may already have adverse health, access to health services, and autonomy and participation compared to those without disability, are able toreceive preventative health and social care during periods of restriction. Theimpact of social distancing restrictions on people with disability is not uniformnor well-understood. Research has been cross-sectional and considered datagathered during social distancing restrictions, or longitudinal, considering datagathered during a pre-pandemic baseline. This longitudinal study investigated theimpact of lifting social distancing restrictions on priority domains for peoplewith disability including autonomy and participation, access to health services, health issues and quality of life. People with spinal cord injury in Victoria,Australia (n = 71) completed a survey towards the end of social-distancingrestrictions (T1) and 6-months post social distancing restrictions (T2).Non-parametric tests for significant differences confirmed that 6-monthspost-lifting social distancing restrictions participants experienced asignificant increase in health conditions, a significant decrease in the numberof inaccessible health services, and a significantly lower level of limitationsacross participation and autonomy, outdoor autonomy and work and educationdomains. QOL improved 6-months post lifting restrictions, however not to asignificant level. The adverse health experienced by people with spinal cordinjury after lifting restrictions may in part result from limited health service access and reduced participation during the time of restrictions. Cleardefinitions of what constitutes as essential care may ensure that eligible andrequired care remains received during lockdown or instances when serviceprovision is compromised. Health and social care providers should be equippedwith the knowledge of priority populations so that their support can be targeted to those most in need.

TI  - Evolving strategies in whirlwind mode: The changing face of anatomy educationduring Covid-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1002/ase.2214 [doi]
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic stipulated adoption of unfamiliar strategies for deliveringanatomy education in online mode. The factors which determine educationstrategies are variable across geographical regions. It was perceived than anoverview of education strategies around the globe would be useful for anatomists.Hence this narrative review was undertaken to collate observations from differentgeographical regions pertaining to education strategies adopted during thepandemic. Data relevant to the topic of study were extracted from 12 articlesthat were selected from an initial pool of 317 articles based on search criteria set for the review. Subtle differences in core education strategies implied that baseline response from anatomists were similar across regions. It was evidentthat online digital tools were key elements of education strategies adopted byeducators for delivering online anatomy classes across the globe. Interestingly, a considerable gap in terms of number and variety of online tools used foranatomy education (those requiring commercial purchase) was noted betweeneconomically developed and developing regions. This may have an impact onlearning outcome for students and may even lead to variations in anatomicalknowledge by regions. It was observed that offline human dissection sessions wereincorporated into online practical classes in one region as positive cases showeda declining trend. This positive development is worth emulating elsewhere basedon cautious assessment of prevailing situation. From a broad perspective timelyintroduction of education strategies ensured delivery of anatomy education duringthe pandemic and gave an evolved outlook to the fabric of anatomy education.

AB  - Objective: To compare Anti-Xa directed thromboprophylaxis using low molecularweight heparin (LMWH) (anti-Xa peak goal 0.2-0.5 IU/mL) to alternativeanticoagulation strategies in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: This wasa retrospective, multicenter, single health-system study. Primary outcomes werethromboembolic events and clinically important bleeding events. Secondaryoutcomes included dosing comparisons between LMWH cohorts. Main Results: A total of 695 patients were included. No differences were found in the incidence ofthrombotic events with any of the dosing strategies. The incidence of majorbleeding was significantly higher in the standard dose thromboprophylaxis,intermediate dose subcutaneous heparin (SQH), and therapeutic anticoagulationcohorts. Forty-nine percent of patients within the anti-Xa directed group hadtheir first anti-Xa peak at goal, while 43% were above goal. Patients who hadlevels above goal had dose modifications made, therefore anti-Xa directed LMWHresulted in significantly lower total daily doses compared to intermediate doseLMWH. Conclusions: Anti-Xa directed LMWH dosing provided comparablethromboprophylaxis with lower total daily doses of LMWH in critically illCOVID-19 patients. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm ourfindings.

TI  - BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination Against COVID-19 is Associated with DecreasedLikelihood of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in U.S. Children Ages 5-18 Years.
LID - ciac637 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), linked toantecedent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection, is associated with considerable morbidity. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by vaccination might alsodecrease MIS-C likelihood. METHODS: In a multicenter case-control public healthinvestigation of children ages 5-18 years hospitalized from July 1, 2021 to April7, 2022, we compared the odds of being fully vaccinated (two doses of BNT162b2vaccine >/=28 days before hospital admission) between MIS-C case-patients andhospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. These associationswere examined by age group, timing of vaccination, and periods of Delta andOmicron variant predominance using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Wecompared 304 MIS-C case-patients (280 [92%] unvaccinated) with 502 controls (346 [69%] unvaccinated). MIS-C was associated with decreased likelihood ofvaccination (aOR, 0.16 95% CI, 0.10-0.26), including among children ages 5-11years (aOR, 0.22 95% CI, 0.10-0.52), ages 12-18 years (aOR, 0.10 95% CI,0.05-0.19), and during the Delta (aOR, 0.06 95% CI, 0.02-0.15) and Omicron (aOR, 0.22 95% CI, 0.11-0.42) variant-predominant periods. This association persistedbeyond 120 days after the second dose (aOR, 0.08, 95% CI, 0.03-0.22) in 12-18year-olds. Among all MIS-C case-patients, 187 (62%) required intensive care unit admission and 280 (92%) vaccine-eligible patients were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS:Vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 is associated with reduced likelihood ofMIS-C in children ages 5-18 years. Most vaccine eligible hospitalized patientswith MIS-C were unvaccinated.

TI  - Using mobile phones, WhatsApp and phone interviews to explore how children'shospice nurses manage long-term relationships with parents: a feasibility pilot.
LID - 10.7748/nr.2022.e1849 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phones are familiar to most nurses, but the applicationsavailable for voice recording and transfer of audio files in research may not be.AIM: To provide an overview of a pilot study which trialled the use of mobilephones, WhatsApp and phone interviews as a safe and reliable means of collecting data. DISCUSSION: A pilot study was designed to test the use of: mobile phones asa safe and reliable way to record audio diaries as research data; WhatsApp totransmit the audio files; and phone interviews to explore them. Undertaking thepilot demonstrated that the tools proposed for collecting data were useable andacceptable to the target population and that the researcher's guidance for doing so was satisfactory. CONCLUSION: New technologies enable innovation but triallingthem for useability is important. Confidentiality and consent need to becarefully managed when using WhatsApp to ensure a study is compliant with dataprotection regulations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Collection of research datadigitally and remotely has become increasingly mainstream and relied on duringthe COVID 19 pandemic. The methods discussed in this article provide solutionsfor timely data collection that are particularly useful when the researcher isgeographically distant from participants. The 'in the moment' reflective natureof the audio diaries could also be applicable to non-research settings - forexample, as a method of assisting ongoing professional development and/orcollection of reflective accounts.

TI  - Geriatric risk and protective factors for serious COVID-19 outcomes among olderadults in Shanghai Omicron wave.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2022.2109517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omicron variant was featured with high transmissibility and striking antibody evasion. Shanghai has been experiencing Omicron wave since March 2022.Though several studies have evaluated the risk factors of severe infections, the analyses of BA.2 infection risk and protective factors among geriatric people wasmuch limited. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study described clinicalcharacteristics of geriatric Omicron infections (aged more than 60), and assessedrisk and protective factors for severe infections. RESULTS: A total of 1377patients older than 60 were enrolled, with 75.96% had comorbidities. The medianviral shedding time and hospitalization time was 9 and 8 days, respectively.Severe/critical were associated with longer virus clearance time (aOR[95%CI]:0.706(0.533-0.935), P=0.015)), while fully vaccinated/booster andpaxlovid use shortened viral shedding time (1.229 [1.076-1.402], P=0.002; 1.140[.019-1.274], P=0.022, respectively). Older age (>80), cerebrovascular disease,and chronic kidney disease were risk factors of progressing to severe/critical.Fully vaccination was a significant protective factor of severe infections(0.237[0.071-0.793], P=0.019). Further, we found patients with more than twocomorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome in all age groups.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that in the elderly older than 60 yearsold, older age (aged over 80), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidneydisease were risk factors of severe infection. Patients with more than twocomorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome. Fully vaccinated/boosterpatients were less likely to be severe and vaccinations could shorten viralshedding time. The limitation of lacking overall spectrum of COVID-19 infections among elders could be compensated in other larger scale studies in the future.

AB  - Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, French healthcare practitioners seldom usedteleconsultations in France. COVID-19 has brought with it a great need for theuse of teleconsultation and other interventions using digital technology. Thestudy's objective was to identify how French healthcare practitioners usedteleconsultation for obstetrics and gynecology care services before and duringCOVID-19. Our study used a survey of French healthcare practitioners specializingin obstetrics and gynecology from 1 March 2020, to 31 April 2020. We firstdescribed the global picture of the teleconsultation context prior to COVID-19and then during the first lockdown measures. For both contexts, we set up threeaspects: 1- teleconsultation regarding providers' ability; 2- teleconsultationwith regards to its technological features; and 3- teleconsultation for whichtype of healthcare. Second, we mobilized logit models to study the determinantfactors of teleconsultation use as well as what drives provider satisfaction withteleconsultation practice. We show the central role of training, and theimportance of some main digital technology benefits, namely improving publichealth, responding to patients' requests, and facilitating healthcare access. We also exhibit the importance of the limitations specifically related to the lackof convenience in digital technology use and the lack of trust in the digitalservice provided. Our results guide policy makers on suppliers' motivation andneeds for teleconsultation adoption. These results highlight the conditions forefficient use of teleconsultation.

TI  - Enhancing Artificial Intelligence for Twitter-based Public Discourse on FoodSecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 1-25
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Food security during public health emergencies relies on situationalawareness of needs and resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionizedsituational awareness during crises, allowing the allocation of resources toneeds through machine learning algorithms. Limited research exists monitoringTwitter for changes in the food security-related public discourse during theCOVID-19 pandemic. We aim to address that gap with AI by classifying foodsecurity topics on Twitter and showing topic frequency per day. METHODS: Tweetswere scraped from Twitter from January 2020 through December 2021 using foodsecurity keywords. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling wasperformed, followed by time-series analyses on topic frequency per day. RESULTS: 237,107 tweets were scraped and classified into topics, including food needs and resources, emergency preparedness and response, and mental/physical health. Afterthe WHO's pandemic declaration, there were relative increases in topic densityper day regarding food pantries, food banks, economic and food security crises,essential services, and emergency preparedness advice. Threats to food securityin Tigray emerged in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: AI is a powerful yet underused tool tomonitor food insecurity on social media. Machine learning tools to improveemergency response should be prioritized, along with measurement of impact.Further food insecurity word patterns testing, as generated by this research,with supervised machine learning models can accelerate the uptake of these tools by policymakers and aid organizations.

TI  - Measuring work-related risk of COVID-19: comparison of COVID-19 incidence byoccupation and industry - Wisconsin, September 2020-May 2021.
LID - ciac586 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Work-related exposures play an important role in SARS-CoV-2transmission, yet few studies have measured the risk of COVID-19 acrossoccupations and industries. METHODS: During September 2020 - May 2021, theWisconsin Department of Health Services collected occupation and industry data aspart of routine COVID-19 case investigations. Adults aged 18-64 years withconfirmed or probable COVID-19 in Wisconsin were assigned standardized occupationand industry codes. Cumulative incidence rates were weighted for non-response andcalculated using full-time equivalent (FTE) workforce denominators from the 2020 American Community Survey. RESULTS: An estimated 11.6% of workers (347,013 of2.98 million) in Wisconsin, ages 18-64 years, had COVID-19 from September 2020 toMay 2021. The highest incidence by occupation (per 100 full-time equivalents)occurred among personal care and services workers (22.4), healthcarepractitioners and support staff (20.7), and protective services workers (20.7).High risk sub-groups included nursing assistants and personal care aides (28.8), childcare workers (25.8), food and beverage service workers (25.3), personalappearance workers (24.4), and law enforcement workers (24.1). By industry,incidence was highest in healthcare (18.6); the highest risk sub-sectors werenursing care facilities (30.5) and warehousing (28.5). CONCLUSIONS: This analysisrepresents one of the most complete examinations to date of COVID-19 incidence byoccupation and industry. Our approach demonstrates the value of standardizedoccupational data collection by public health, and may be a model for improvedoccupational surveillance elsewhere. Workers at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2exposure may benefit from targeted workplace COVID-19 vaccination and mitigation efforts.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the world. In Canada, the impacthas been worrisome. Canada is a large, sparsely populated country with a systemof universal health care that is decided nationally and enacted by each province and territory. There are variations in health care, as well as in the provisionof social work, throughout the country. The aim of this survey is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social workers employed in health care.Participants were recruited for an online survey via social media, professionalassociations, and social work education programs. Three hundred and seventy-sixsocial workers participated. Analyses were performed to: (1) investigate thechanges in workplace conditions indicated by social workers as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic; (2) examine reported levels of distress, social support,quality of professional life, resilience, and posttraumatic growth amongrespondents during this time; and (3) contextualize these findings by exploringsimilarities and differences across geographic locations. Many respondents weredeemed essential workers. Significant differences across regions were not found. The knowledge generated has important implications for all sectors of the social work profession in Canada.

TI  - The Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Related Medications on COVID-19Severity and Outcome: A Tertiary Referral Center Experience from Turkey.
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2022.22059 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 has become a serious pandemic, and stillremains a risk despite vaccines that have been devel- oped. Among inflammatorybowel disease patients old age, inflammatory bowel disease activation, theexistence of the comorbid dis- ease, and using steroids are known risk factorsfor severe coronavirus disease-2019. But there are different data for drugs otherthan corticosteroids used. The aims of the study are to evaluate the prevalenceand risk factors of severe coronavirus disease-2019 and the effect ofinflammatory bowel disease drugs on severe coronavirus disease-2019. METHODS: In this study among 1195 inflammatory bowel disease patients, 130 patients who were found to be positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between March 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated. Patients were divided into 3 groups asmild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease-2019. RESULTS: Among 130 patients,91 (70%) had mild, 16 (12.3%) had moderate, and 23 (17.7%) had severe coronavirusdisease-2019. Being 60 years of age or older (P = .009), having at least 1comorbid disease (P = .002), and having active inflammatory bowel disease (P =.001) were factors that increased the risk for severe coronavirus disease-2019.The use of mesalazine (P = .35), biologic agents (P = .23), and corticosteroids(P = .42) did not increase the risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019. The useof azathioprine seemed to decrease the risk of severe disease with univariateregression analysis however the significance disappeared with multivariateanalysis. CONCLUSION: Older age, active inflammatory bowel disease, and existenceof at least 1 comorbid disease are risk factors for severe coro- navirusdisease-2019. However, drugs used in inflammatory bowel disease management do notincrease the risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019. But due to the small numberof patients, it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion aboutcorticosteroids.

TI  - Right-Wing Populist Parties' Bordering Narratives in Times of Crisis:Anti-Immigration Discourse in the Genevan Borderland during the COVID-19Pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12516 [doi]
AB  - Right-wing populist parties (RWPPs) view immigration as a threat to nationalidentity and cultural and political cohesion. This paper explores the discourseon immigration of two such parties during a systemic crisis (the COVID-19pandemic) in a borderland area that entails a specific "symbolization" of theborder as a result of geographic proximity. What kind of bordering narrativesoccur in this context, and how do they evolve? To answer these questions, themajor RWPPs operating in the Geneva region were studied: the Genevan SwissPeople's Party and the Geneva Citizens' Movement. Through a critical discourseanalysis, a total of 181 documents published between 1 January and 31 August 2020were analyzed, including the parties' official Facebook posts, press releases,and newspaper articles. Results show that the context of the pandemic favored theemergence of a strong re-bordering narrative.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2-Specific Adaptive Immunity in COVID-19 Survivors With Asthma.
PG  - 947724
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.947724 [doi]
AB  - Background: Asthma patients potentially have impaired adaptive immunity to virus infection. The levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity between COVID-19survivors with and without asthma are presently unclear. Methods: COVID-19survivors (patients with asthma n=11, with allergies n=8, and COVID-19 only n=17)and non-COVID-19 individuals (asthmatic patients n=10 and healthy controls n=9)were included. The COVID-19 patients were followed up at about 8 months and 16months after discharge. The clinical characteristics, lymphocyte subsets, memory T cells, and humoral immunity including SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies,SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, and memory B cells wereanalyzed in these subjects. Results: The strength of virus-specific T cellresponse in COVID-19 survivors was positively correlated with the percentage ofblood eosinophils and Treg cells (r=0.4007, p=0.0188; and r=0.4435, p=0.0086respectively) at 8-month follow-up. There were no statistical differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response between the COVID-19 survivorswith, and without, asthma. Compared to those without asthma, the COVID-19 withasthma survivors had higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies(NAbs) at the 8-month follow-up (p<0.05). Moreover, the level of NAbs in COVID-19survivors was positively correlated with the percentage of Treg and cTfh2 cells(r=0.5037, p=0.002; and r=0.4846, p=0.0141), and negatively correlated with thepercentage of Th1 and Th17 cells (r=-0.5701, p=0.0003; and r=-0.3656, p=0.0308), the ratio of Th1/Th2, Th17/Treg, and cTfh1/cTfh2 cell (r=-0.5356, r=-0.5947,r=-0.4485; all p<0.05). The decay rate of NAbs in the COVID-19 survivors withasthma was not significantly different from that of those without asthma at16-month follow-up. Conclusion: The level of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs in COVID-19survivors with asthma was higher than that of those without asthma at 8-monthfollow-up. The SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity was associated with bloodeosinophils and Treg percentages. The SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity wasclosely associated with cTfh2/cTfh1 imbalance and Treg/Th17 ratio. According tothe findings, asthmatic patients in COVID-19 convalescent period may benefit froman enhanced specific humoral immunity, which associates with skewed Th2/Th1 andTreg/Th17 immune.

AB  - The metabolic characteristics of COVID-19 disease are still largely unknown.Here, 44 patients with COVID-19 (31 mild COVID-19 patients and 13 severe COVID-19patients), 42 healthy controls (HC), and 42 patients with community-acquiredpneumonia (CAP), were involved in the study to assess their serum metabolomicprofiles. We used widely targeted metabolomics based on an ultra-performanceliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The differentiallyexpressed metabolites in the plasma of mild and severe COVID-19 patients, CAPpatients, and HC subjects were screened, and the main metabolic pathways involvedwere analyzed. Multiple mature machine learning algorithms confirmed that themetabolites performed excellently in discriminating COVID-19 groups from CAP and HC subjects, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1. The specific dysregulation of AMP, dGMP, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and carnitine was observed in thesevere COVID-19 group. Moreover, random forest analysis suggested that thesemetabolites could discriminate between severe COVID-19 patients and mild COVID-19patients, with an AUC of 0.921. This study may broaden our understanding ofpathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 and may offer an experimental basis fordeveloping novel treatment strategies against it.

PG  - 894872
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.894872 [doi]
AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune neurological disorder oftenpreceded by viral illnesses or, more rarely, vaccinations. We report on a unique combination of postcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine GBS that occurred months after a parainfectious COVID-19-related GBS. Shortly after manifestingCOVID-19 symptoms, a 57-year-old man developed diplopia, right-side facialweakness, and gait instability that, together with electrophysiology andcerebrospinal fluid examinations, led to a diagnosis of post-COVID-19 GBS. Theinvolvement of cranial nerves and IgM seropositivity for ganglioside GD1b werenoteworthy. COVID-19 pneumonia, flaccid tetraparesis, and autonomic dysfunctionprompted his admission to ICU. He recovered after therapy with intravenousimmunoglobulins (IVIg). Six months later, GBS recurred shortly after the firstdose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Again, the GBS diagnosis was confirmed bycerebrospinal fluid and electrophysiology studies. IgM seropositivity extended tomultiple gangliosides, namely for GM3/4, GD1a/b, and GT1b IgM. An IVIg courseprompted complete recovery. This case adds to other previously reportedobservations suggesting a possible causal link between SARS-CoV-2 and GBS.Molecular mimicry and anti-idiotype antibodies might be the underlyingmechanisms. Future COVID-19 vaccinations/revaccinations in patients with previouspara-/post-COVID-19 GBS deserve a reappraisal, especially if they areseropositive for ganglioside antibodies.

TI  - Are Face Masks a Problem for Emotion Recognition? Not When the Whole Body IsVisible.
PG  - 915927
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2022.915927 [doi]
AB  - The rise of the novel COVID-19 virus has made face masks commonplace items aroundthe globe. Recent research found that face masks significantly impair emotionrecognition on isolated faces. However, faces are rarely seen in isolation andthe body is also a key cue for emotional portrayal. Here, therefore, weinvestigated the impact of face masks on emotion recognition when surveying thefull body. Stimuli expressing anger, happiness, sadness, and fear were selectedfrom the BEAST stimuli set. Masks were added to these images and participantswere asked to recognize the emotion and give a confidence level for that decisionfor both the masked and unmasked stimuli. We found that, contrary to some workviewing faces in isolation, emotion recognition was generally not impaired byface masks when the whole body is present. We did, however, find that whenviewing masked faces, only the recognition of happiness significantly decreasedwhen the whole body was present. In contrast to actual performance, confidencelevels were found to decline during the Mask condition across all emotionalconditions. This research suggests that the impact of masks on emotionrecognition may not be as pronounced as previously thought, as long as the whole body is also visible.

TI  - A Way Forward in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Making the Case for Narrative Competence in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.
PG  - 188-196
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2022-0021PS [doi]
AB  - Each surge of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presented newchallenges to pulmonary and critical care practitioners. Although some of theinitial challenges were somewhat less acute, clinicians now are left to face the physical, emotional, and mental toll of the past 2 years. The pandemic revealed aneed for a more varied skillset, including space for reflection, tolerance ofuncertainty, and humanism. These skills can assist clinicians who are left toheal from the difficulty of caring for patients in the absence of families whowere excluded from the intensive care unit, public distrust of vaccines, andmorgues overtaken by our patients. As pulmonary and critical care medicinepractitioners and educators, we believe that cultivating practices, pedagogies,and institutional structures that foster narrative competence, "the ability toacknowledge, absorb, interpret, and act on the stories and plights of others," inour ourselves, our trainees, and our colleagues, may provide a productive wayforward. In addition to fostering needed skills, this practice can promotenecessary healing as well. This perspective introduces the practice of narrative competence, provides evidence of support for its implementation, and suggestsopportunities for curricular integration.

TI  - Beyond the ICU Rotation: The Importance of Trainee Involvement in Post-Intensive Care Unit Clinics.
PG  - 180-187
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2021-0126PS [doi]
AB  - Medical learners are vital to the care of critically ill patients in theintensive care unit (ICU). Although these learners are exposed to the challenges and stresses of acute ICU management, they do not typically experience thebenefits of following ICU patients and families longitudinally after their ICUrotation. Post-ICU clinics and recovery programs may fill this crucial gap intrainee education. These clinics have emerged as an appealing approach topotentially support patient recovery, enhance provider satisfaction, and provide feedback on vital lessons learned in long-term follow-up to improve the qualityof ICU care. Notably, the effect of such a program on trainee education has notbeen explored. In this article, we propose a framework for medical learnerparticipation in post-ICU follow-up based on the Accreditation Council forGraduate Medical Education milestones and discuss the potential benefits,including: education about post-ICU recovery, including post-intensive caresyndrome and post-intensive care syndrome-family; experience in qualityimprovement to enhance ICU care by understanding long-term outcomes; engagementin reflection; and mitigation of compassion fatigue and burnout.

TI  - Creation of an International Interprofessional Simulation-enhanced MechanicalVentilation Course.
PG  - 270-284
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2021-0102OC [doi]
AB  - Background: Evidence shows poor adherence to strategies for reducing morbidityand mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving mechanicalventilation globally. Best practice management relies on training all members of the interprofessional ICU team, each with complementary roles in patientmanagement. Objectives: To develop and evaluate a novel two-phase,train-the-trainer, interprofessional and multicultural "Best Practice Management of the Ventilated ICU Patient" multimodality, simulation-enhanced curriculum for Thai education leaders in critical care. Methods: In phase 1 (Oregon Health andScience University cohort), two groups of nine ICU nurses and one critical carephysician representing experts in critical care and education from a largehospital system in Thailand participated in a weeklong, immersive courseconsisting of didactic, simulation, and in situ immersive sessions focused onbest practice management of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, as well astraining in our educational techniques. Outcomes were assessed with pre- andpostcourse knowledge assessments and overall course evaluation. In phase 2 (Thai cohort), participants from phase 1 returned to Thailand and implemented a lowerfidelity curriculum in two hospitals, using the same pre- and posttest knowledge assessment in 41 participants, before the onset of the coronavirus disease(COVID-19) 6 pandemic. Results: In the Oregon Health and Science Universitycohort, the mean pretest knowledge score was 58.4 +/- 13.2%, with a meanimprovement to 82.5 +/- 11.6% after completion of the course (P , 0.05). Thegreatest improvements were seen in respiratory physiology andadvanced/disease-specific concepts, which demonstrated absolute improvements of30.4% and 30.6%, respectively (P < 0.05). Participants had a high degree ofsatisfaction, with 90% rating the course as "excellent" and .90% reporting thatthe course "greatly improved" their understanding of best practices and comfortin managing mechanical ventilation. The Thai cohort had a mean baseline score of 45.4 +/- 15.0% and a mean improvement to 70.3 +/- 19.1% after training (P <0.05). This cohort also saw the greatest improvement in respiratory physiologyand advanced/disease-specific concepts, with 26.2% and 26.3% absoluteimprovements, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A novel, two-phase,interprofessional, multicultural, simulation-enhanced train-the-trainercurriculum was feasible and effective in improving education in best practicemanagement of mechanically ventilated patients and may be a useful model forimproving the care of ICU patients across the world.

AB  - Purpose: Various parameters have been proposed to predict the outcome of patientswith coronavirus disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility ofthe age-adjusted CCI score and biochemical parameters for predicting outcomes forCOVID-19 patients on admission. Patients and methods: A total of 511 patientswere included in the study. Only swab or serological tests positive patients wereincluded. The clinical characteristics of the patients were compared betweensurvival and non-survival COVID-19 inpatients. Hemoglobin, platelet,sedimentation, creatinine, AST, ALT, LDH, CK, albumin, ferritin, lymphocyte,neutrophil, CRP (1-5;5-10;10-20 x upper limit), procalcitonin (5-10;10-20; > 20 xupper limit), D Dimer (> 2 x upper limit), age, gender, chronic diseases and CCI scores were compared between the two groups. Results: 68 patients died and 443patients survived. Mean age was 74.3+/-7.3 years in survival group and 76.7+/-8.0in nonsurvival group. Age, male sex, ischemic heart disease (CHD), chronic kidneydisease and active malignancy was statistically higher in non-survivor group. Thebiochemical parameters was compared in survival and nonsurvival group. CCI score,AST, LDH, CK, Ferritin, CRP are significantly higher and albumin, lymphocytelevels are significantly lower in nonsurvival group. D-dimer and procalcitoninlevels are significantly higher in nonsurvival group. CCI score and neutrophil,creatinine, ALT, AST, d-dimer and procalcitonin elevations were correlated. Lowalbumin and lymphocyte levels were correlated with the CCI score. There was nosignificant correlation between ferritin, sedimentation, CRP levels and CCIscore. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that anaemia,elevated CRP (> 10-20 x upper limit), procalcitonin (> 5-10 x upper limit), ALT, AST levels and higher CCI score were independent risk factors for mortality inCOVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Anaemia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin levels, ALT, AST levels and higher CCI score were found independent risk factors for mortalityin COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Physical distancing requirements due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic hasincreased the need for broadband internet access. The World Health Organizationdefines social determinants of health as non-medical factors that impact healthoutcomes by affecting the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age. By this definition broadband internet access is a social determinant of health. Digital redlining-the systematic process by which specific groups aredeprived of equal access to digital tools such as the internet-creates inequitiesin access to educational and employment opportunities, as well as healthcare and health information. Although it is known that internet service providerssystematically exclude low-income communities from broadband service, little has been done to stop this discriminatory practice. In this paper, we seek to amplifythe call to action against the practice of digital redlining in the UnitedStates, describe how it contributes to health disparities broadly and within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and use a socio-ecological framework to proposeshort- and long-term actions to address this inequity.

AB  - The involvement of the neurological system by coronavirus has been wellestablished. Since its onset, the systemic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been evolving rapidly and imaging plays a pivotal role indiagnosing the various primary and secondary effects of the disease. As thepandemic continues to defy human civilization, secondary impacts of the diseaseand the treatment given to patients afflicted with the disease have stemmed up.Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is one such potentially dangerous infectionnow commonly seen in COVID-19 patients, especially the ones treated withimmunosuppressants. Early diagnosis is key for COVID-19-associated mucormycosis(CAM), and radiologists should be well aware of its alarming neurologicalmanifestations from the involvement of parenchyma, meninges, vessels, cranialnerves, and skull base. This review highlights the magnetic resonance imagingfeatures of neuraxial involvement in CAM.

LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1744140 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 was paralleled by anequally overwhelming publication of scientific literature. This scientometricanalysis was performed to evaluate the 100 most cited articles on COVID-19imaging to highlight research trends and identify common characteristics of themost cited works. A search of the Web of Science database was performed using thekeywords "COVID CT," "COVID Radiograph," and "COVID Imaging" on June 29, 2021.The 100 top cited articles found were arranged in descending order on the basisof citation counts and citations per year and relevant data were recorded. Oursearch revealed a total of 4,862 articles on COVID-19 imaging published in theyears 2020 to 2021. The journal with maximum number of publications ( n = 22),citation count ( n = 8,788), and impact was Radiology . Citations for the top 100articles ranged from 70 to 1,742 with the most cited article authored by A.I. Taoand published in Radiology . Two authors tied at first spot, having maximumimpact, with both having 5 publications and a total of 3,638 citations amongthem. China was the leading country with both the maximum number of publications ( n = 49) and total citations ( n = 13,892), the United States coming second inboth. This study evaluates publication and citation trends in literature andshows that the countries most affected by the pandemic early on have contributed to the majority of the literature. Furthermore, it will help radiologists torefer to the most popular and important article texts on which to base theirunbiased and confident diagnoses.

TI  - Rights redistribution and COVID-19 lockdown policy.
PG  - 5-36
LID - 10.1007/s10657-022-09732-x [doi]
AB  - What is the tenet upon which the public policy of lockdown by fiat experiencedduring the COVID-19 pandemic is based on? The work approaches this question aboutthe rationale of the mandatory shelter-in-place policy as an interpersonalexchange of rights, but where the exchange occurs coercively instead ofvoluntarily. It compares, in positive political economy terms, the normativeprinciples of utilitarianism and Rawlsianism, and shows that lockdown by fiat is a policy that is closer to a maximin equity criterion rather than to autilitarian one. The work moreover shows, also with the aid of a thoughtexperiment and with factual applications, that the fiat redistribution of rights to liberty in favor of rights to health-from those least affected to those mostaffected by COVID-19-is, in the main, a policy choice that is to be expectedunder certain constraints.

PG  - 37-61
LID - 10.1007/s10657-021-09704-7 [doi]
AB  - We argue that institutions are bundles that involve trade-offs in thegovernment's ability to provide public goods that affect public health. Wehypothesize that the institutions underlying economic freedom affect the mix ofdiseases by reducing diseases of poverty relative to diseases of commerce (those associated with free movement of people, such as smallpox or COVID-19). We focus on smallpox and typhoid fever in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in order to build on recent work that make arguments similar to ours,especially the framework Werner Troesken sets forth in The Pox of Liberty. Ourevidence shows that economic freedom, in multiple periods of time and settingsprior to the eradication of smallpox in the second half of the twentieth century,reduced typhoid mortality but had no effect on smallpox deaths. The implicationfor COVID-19 is that the trade-off between fighting the pandemic and preservingeconomic freedom may not be too severe in the short run. However, in the longrun, the wealth benefits from economic freedom are likely to be crucial inreducing vulnerability to diseases of commerce primarily from their impact oncomorbidities (such as diabetes and heart disease). Thus, economic freedom is on balance good for public health, which suggests that it, while requiringtrade-offs, might be the best institutional bundle for dealing with pandemics.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary materialavailable at 10.1007/s10657-021-09704-7.

AB  - Commercial and social entrepreneurs are likely to help communities combat public health crises. Research on responses to pandemics has underappreciated thecritical role of entrepreneurs. In the context of post-disaster response andrecovery, entrepreneurs provide needed goods and services, repair and rebuilddisrupted social networks, and can act as focal points for disaster survivors as they develop their plans to rebuild. During a pandemic, entrepreneurs performsimilarly important economic and social functions. This article highlights these functions, including (1) providing the goods needed to survive and combat thepandemic, (2) performing the services needed so that people can stay productiveand connected during the pandemic, and (3) acting as a source of communitysupport and leadership. It also discusses how entrepreneurs are able to performthese roles despite operating in an environment that constricts the range andnature of entrepreneurial activity. Finally, this article describes a legalregime that will promote entrepreneurship during a pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has not only caused millions to die and even more to losetheir jobs, it has also prompted more governments to simultaneously declare astate of emergency than ever before enabling us to compare their decisions moredirectly. States of emergency usually imply the extension of executive powersthat diminishes the powers of other branches of government, as well as to thecivil liberties of individuals. Here, we analyze the use of emergency provisions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and find that it can be largelyexplained by drawing on political economy. It does, hence, not constitute anexception. We show that many governments have (mis-)used the pandemic as apretext to curtail media freedom. We further show that executive decrees areconsidered as a substitute for states of emergency by many governments.

AB  - From an epidemiological perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic is a public healthcrisis. From an economic perspective, it is an externality and a social cost.Strikingly, almost all economic policy to address the infection externality hasbeen formulated within a Pigovian analysis of implicit taxes and subsidiesdirected by a social planner drawing on social cost-benefit analysis. In thispaper we examine the alternative economic methodology of the externality. We seekto understand how an exchange-focused and institutional analysis provides abetter understanding of how to minimise social cost. Our Coasean framework allowsus to further develop a comparative institutional analysis of the pandemicresponse.

TI  - Decentralisation in Times of Crisis: Asset Or Liability? The Case of Germany and Italy During Covid-19.
PG  - 105-115
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12482 [doi]
AB  - How did the legal and political-administrative relationship between central andlocal governments of two decentralised states shape their response to COVID-19?Literature and theories on decentralisation argue that federal and decentralised states are less able to respond to crises in a coordinated manner due to theirperceived greater susceptibility to political conflict. Situated within thistheoretical debate and based on the analysis of legal acts, political decisions, and relevant national news media articles between March and August 2020 inGermany and Italy, this research note shows that, counterintuitively, moredecentralisation does not necessarily translate into more legal and politicalstress during pandemic management. In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,Germany, a highly decentralised state, experienced less legal and politicaltensions than the less decentralised Italy. The key to understanding thisvariation lies in different institutional arrangements, complemented by thespecific political cultures of both states.

PG  - 449-457
LID - 10.1080/02786826.2020.1862409 [doi]
AB  - Face masks are recommended to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. One ofthe primary benefits of face masks and other coverings is as source controldevices to reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols during coughing,breathing, and speaking. Face shields and neck gaiters have been proposed as analternative to face masks, but information about face shields and neck gaiters assource control devices is limited. We used a cough aerosol simulator with apliable skin headform to propel small aerosol particles (0 to 7 mum) intodifferent face coverings. An N95 respirator blocked 99% (standard deviation (SD) 0.3%) of the cough aerosol, a medical grade procedure mask blocked 59% (SD 6.9%),a 3-ply cotton cloth face mask blocked 51% (SD 7.7%), and a polyester neck gaiterblocked 47% (SD 7.5%) as a single layer and 60% (SD 7.2%) when folded into adouble layer. In contrast, the face shield blocked 2% (SD 15.3%) of the coughaerosol. Our results suggest that face masks and neck gaiters are preferable toface shields as source control devices for cough aerosols.

PG  - 4037-4046
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S370837 [doi]
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) are among the top ongoing health crises globally. Both cause respiratorydiseases, and the clinical presentations are similar. There is no summarizedinformation about cases of COVID-19 patients with concomitant TB infection fromdifferent settings. Therefore this review aimed to summerize the clinicalfeatures and treatment outcomes of coronavirus and tuberculosis co-infectedpatients. Methods: An electronic search of case reports published between 2020and 2021 was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect.From eligible reports, data were collected for the selected variables. Weanalyzed the collected information using SPSS version 27 software. Descriptivestatistics were computed for the selected variables. Results: A total of 83patient histories were collected from 47 case reports. The majority (80%) of the cases were reported for male patients. The mean age was 42.6 years (3 months to84 years, SD=17.3). Fever was reported in 80% of cases, followed by cough (73.3%)and hypotension (37.1%). Blood cell parameters revealed lymphopenia (52%), lower hemoglobin (30%), elevated CRP (70%), elevated ferritin (28%), and increasedD-dimer (23.4%). Treatment outcome is significantly associated with blood cellcount results (p-0.044) and a rise in blood inflammatory cytokines(p-0.041). The mean days for viral clearance or negative PCR was 23 days (Range 5-82 days) andthe overall mean duration of hospitalization was 27 days. The total death ratewas 22.4%. Recovery was reported for 76.6% of cases. Survival status (p-0.613)and disease severity (p-0.68) are not significantly associated with the gender ofthe participants. Conclusion: An alteration in blood cell parameters isassociated with an unfavorable treatment outcome. There is a higher death rate inCOVID-19/TB co-infection. The death is associated with older age, smoking orsmoking history, drug abuse, and co-morbidity of non-communicable diseases.Conversely, there is a lower death rate in HIV patients.

TI  - The Safety of Same-day Discharge after Immediate Alloplastic BreastReconstruction: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e4448
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004448 [doi]
AB  - Background: Implant-based breast reconstruction can be accomplished in a variety of ways and can result in vastly different postoperative experiences forpatients. The COVID-19 pandemic and recent trends have resulted in a shift towardoutpatient management of these patients. Methods: A systematic review of PubMedand Embase databases was conducted. A total of 1328 articles were identified oninitial search, and after several rounds of review, a total of four met inclusionand exclusion criteria. Manuscripts were included if postmastectomy alloplasticbreast reconstruction was performed, and there was documentation of same-daydischarge. This cohort of patients was compared with traditional, plannedovernight admission cohorts found in the literature. Objective data comparedbetween groups included preoperative patient factors and postoperativecomplication rates. Results: Four studies representing data on a total of 574patients were included: 289 were same-day discharge and 285 were overnightadmission. Patient characteristics of body mass index, radiation, smoking, andbilateral procedures were comparable. Tissue expanders were used more frequently than implants in both cohorts. The rate of overall complications was 33% forsame-day discharge and 34% for overnight admission. Rates of major and minorcomplications, including infection, seroma, and hematoma, were similar. There wasno increase in reoperations or readmissions reported in any of the studies.Conclusions: Same-day discharge after mastectomy with immediate alloplasticreconstruction is a safe approach to treatment in both the ambulatory andhospital setting. There are comparable rates of common complications such asinfection, seroma, and hematoma, with no increase in readmission or reoperation.

AB  - Background: Knowledge and attitudes are among the key drivers of socialbehavioral change. We assessed employed health professionals' (HPs) knowledge,attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 in Dessie city, northeast Ethiopia.Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 HPsworking at Dessie city from 17 to 21 May 2020. The data were collected using aself-administered structured questionnaire. Knowledge, attitude, and practice aremeasured using 19, 16, and 8 questions, respectively. Knowledge and attitudescores are dichotomized at the 3rd quartile, while practice is using the meanvalue. Data entry and analysis were conducted using EpiData Manager 4.2 and SPSS 25, respectively. Three independent logistic regression analyses were carried outto determine the associated factors. We defined significant association at ap-value of < 0.05. Results: Out of 419 participants, 369 (88.1%) have sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19 (95% CI: 85-91). The mean knowledge score is 16.8with a +/- 2.1 SD. Similarly, 355 (84.7%) of the HPs have a favorable attitudetoward COVID-19 (95% CI: 81-87.9). The mean attitude score is 14 with +/- 2.1 SD.However, practice regarding COVID-19 is adequate only in 69.7% (292) of the HPs(95% CI: 65.2-94). The mean practice score is 5.1 with a +/- 1.3 SD. Sufficientknowledge is significantly associated with the type of health facility (AOR: 4.4,95% CI: 1.4-13.3), degree and above education (AOR: 2.6, 95% Cl: 1.4-4.9), radio availability (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.7), and social media utilization (AOR: 2.3,95% CI: 1.1-5.1). The predictors of favorable attitude are training (AOR: 3.1,95% CI: 1.6-6.1), sufficient knowledge (AOR: 5.2, 95% Cl: 2.6-10.4), and type of health facility (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.2). Conclusion: Most HPs have sufficientknowledge and a favorable attitude regarding COVID-19. However, practice isrelatively low and there remains plenty to build assertive preventive behaviors. The gap between knowledge and practice should be narrowed through an appropriate social and behavioral change communication strategy.

AB  - Introduction: Dental anxiety is a multivariate phenomenon that regularly occursduring a dental procedure. Although it may lead to patients' safety concerns and adverse events in routine treatment, it is often ignored. The purpose of thisresearch is to develop a novel WeChat Applet for dental anxiety (WADA) with thefollowing features and aims: (1) to help patients with dental anxiety management;(2) provide patient with a physical status self-evaluation; and(3) provide aplatform for online assessment and tele-consultancy by dentists. We aimed to testand verify whether such an applet could play a beneficial role before and after adental procedure and facilitate management of high-risk patients during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: During the 12-month survey period(August 2020 to July 2021), a total of 180 patients aged 3-74 years from eightdifferent cities (n = 180 at the end of treatment, n = 25 for the SystemUsability Scale (SUS) and follow-up interview) and 20 medical staff from eightdifferent cities (n =20 for follow-up interview) were evaluated by WADA. At theend of the survey period, the results of the interviews were analyzedthematically. Results: WADA assessment results from 180 patients and follow-upinterview results from 45 participants were analyzed. In this study with a maleto female ratio of 2:3, 75% were found to be suffering from dental anxiety, 86%were found with postoperative complications, and 11 cases were found to havecontraindications to surgery. The total SUS score for WADA is 72.25 above themean score, proving that WADA is a relevant and useful tool before and afterdental treatment. Based on the results of the interviews, the following themeswere identified: patient satisfaction; dentists' effectiveness; multi-center dataintegration; and increase its frequency of usage. Conclusions: The WADA wasdeveloped for dental procedures and is effective for reducing treatment risks,improving patients' satisfaction and dentists' convenience, especially in termsof facilitating management of high-risk patient during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives: The design of the supply chain determines how effectively anyvaccination campaign can be operated. This case study of Switzerland's vaccinesupply chain compares its design with public health objectives. It maps thevaccine supply chain in Switzerland as it was set up to handle the firstshipments of Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 to enable a more holistic view of supplyand demand flows. Recommendations are made to improve emergency logistics ofvaccines in the future. Methods: Twenty-six semi-structured interviews withinternational and Swiss stake-holders were coded and analyzed to arrive at adescription of planning and distribution processes. The vaccine supply chainnetwork structure was mapped, linking upstream and downstream flows of materialand information. The visualization of nodes and flows was combined with spatialinformation, including population data. The results are summarized in narrativeform to support decision-makers across disciplines. Results: Despite adequatevaccine supply, abundant local endowments and high investment in infrastructure, the 2021 design of Switzerland's vaccine supply chain reduced the potential reachof target populations. The segmentation of catchment populations, collaborationbetween administrative units and better use of information on geolocation andmaterial flows could have improved the speed and reach of vaccinations during theemergency response phase. Three recommendations are made for supply chainstructures to support higher vaccination rates in the future. Conclusions: Thevisualization identifies design alternatives which could have improvedvaccination rates under the prevailing conditions. A supply chain map providespublic health officials with a shared view of the vaccine supply chain in orderto better match supply with demand. The case study contributes to developedcountry studies. In order to improve public health outcomes in Switzerland,investments to secure supply, strong national endowments, and excellentinfrastructure must be combined with optimized supply chain design.

AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have significantlyaffected health care systems and daily wellbeing. However, the indirect impactsof the pandemic on birth outcomes are not fully understood. We aimed to examinewhether the pandemic altered risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Thisretrospective cohort study included all singleton births during 2016-2020identified in Women's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. We compared birthoutcomes during COVID-19 pandemic (January-December 2020) with before thepandemic (January-December 2016-2019) using Logstic regression adjusted forconfounders. Results: A total of 19,792 and 92,750 births occurred during andbefore the pandemic, respectively. Maternal characteristics were similar between groups, except maternal age was higher in pandemic cohort. We observed areduction in preterm birth (PTB, <37 weeks) during the pandemic [5.9 vs. 5.1%, OR(95%CI) = 0.86 (0.80, 0.92)], but the difference disappeared after multivariable adjustment [adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.02 (0.94, 1.11)]. Moreover, full term infantsborn during the pandemic had lower birth weights than those born before thepandemic [adjusted beta (95% CI) = -17.4 (-23.9, -10.8)]. Consistently, the risksof low birthweight (LBW, <2,500 g) and small for gestational age (SGA, < P10)were increased [LBW: adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.13 (1.02, 1.24); SGA: adjusted OR(95%CI) = 1.11 (1.02, 1.21)], and the risks of macrosomia (>/=4,000 g) and large for gestational age (LGA, >/=P90) were decreased in the pandemic cohort[macrosomia: adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.82 (0.77, 0.88); LGA: adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.73 (0.69, 0.77)]. Conclusion: In this study, we observed no change in pretermbirth and a decrease in birth weight of full term infants during the pandemic in Nanjing, China.

TI  - Improving Recovery of Irritant Hand Dermatitis in Healthcare Workers WithWorkplace Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 844269
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.844269 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Occupational hand dermatitis is common among healthcare workers,with increased incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Irritant contactdermatitis accounts for the majority of occupational hand dermatitis and islargely due to frequent contact with hand hygiene products. Long-term prognosisof occupational contact dermatitis is often very poor. This study aims toidentify and implement suitable workplace interventions to aid in the recovery ofoccupational irritant hand dermatitis among healthcare workers during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A quality improvement (QI) project was performed in atertiary hospital using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model. Healthcare workers seen atthe Occupational Dermatology Clinic from March 2020 to May 2021 for the firsttime for likely occupational irritant dermatitis were targeted for the project.Four workplace interventions were implemented: (a) substitute currentalcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) with a different, gentler ABHR, (b) alternate ABHR with gentle hand wash products, (c) temporary job modification with less clinicalwork (d) switch latex gloves to nitrile gloves. The improvement was assessedafter 2 months of workplace intervention using a visual analogue scale, based on changes seen on photographs taken at the baseline and monthly review. The target improvement was set at 70% after 2 months of workplace interventions. Results: A total of 21 participants were included in the QI project. All participants werefound to have significant improvement in their hand condition. The estimated meanreduction of signs and symptoms was 80% in comparison to their baseline handcondition before intervention. Conclusion: Workplace interventions such assubstituting irritant hand hygiene products with gentler alternatives andtemporary reduction in clinical duties may be useful in improving the recoveryrate of irritant hand dermatitis among healthcare workers. Areas with high handhygiene workload or high incidences of hand dermatitis may opt to implementsystemic workplace changes.

LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.878396 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of contracting coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19) in their workplace. Infection prevention guidelines and standardoperating procedures were introduced to reduce risk of exposure and preventtransmission. Safe practices during interaction with patients with COVID-19 arecrucial for infection prevention and control (IPC). This study aimed to assessHCWs' compliance to IPC and to determine its association with sociodemographicand organizational factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted between Marchand April 2021 at public healthcare facilities in the east coast of PeninsularMalaysia. HCWs who were involved with COVID-19-related works were invited toparticipate in the online survey. The questionnaire was adapted from the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) Interim Guidance: WHO Risk Assessment and Management ofExposure of Healthcare Workers in the Context of COVID-19. Respondents werecategorized as compliant or non-compliant to IPC. A total of 600 HCWs involved inCOVID-19-related works participated in the survey. Most of them (63.7%) werecompliant to IPC as they responded to all items as "always, as recommended"during interaction with patients with COVID-19. The multivariate analysis showed that non-compliance was significantly associated with working in the emergencydepartment (AOR = 3.16; 95% CI = 1.07-9.31), working as laboratory personnel (AOR= 15.13; 95% CI = 1.36-168.44), health attendant (AOR = 4.42; 95% CI =1.74-11.24), and others (AOR = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.1-12.01), as well as workexperience of more than 10 years (AOR = 4.71; 95% CI = 1.28-17.27). The odds ofnon-compliance among respondents without adequate new norms and personalprotective equipment training were 2.02 (95% CI = 1.08-3.81) more than those withadequate training. Although most of the respondents complied to IPC protocols,compliance status differed according to department, work category, and years ofservice. Ensuring adequate training that will hopefully lead to behavioral changeis crucial to prevent breach in IPC and thus minimize the risk of exposure to andtransmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the scientific community to sharetimely evidence, also in the form of pre-printed papers, not peer reviewed yet.Purpose: To develop an artificial intelligence system for the analysis of thescientific literature by leveraging on recent developments in the field ofArgument Mining. Methodology: Scientific quality criteria were borrowed from two selected Cochrane systematic reviews. Four independent reviewers gave a blindevaluation on a 1-5 scale to 40 papers for each review. These scores were matchedwith the automatic analysis performed by an AM system named MARGOT, whichdetected claims and supporting evidence for the cited papers. Outcomes wereevaluated with inter-rater indices (Cohen's Kappa, Krippendorff's Alpha, s(*)statistics). Results: MARGOT performs differently on the two selected Cochranereviews: the inter-rater indices show a fair-to-moderate agreement of the mostrelevant MARGOT metrics both with Cochrane and the skilled interval scores, with larger values for one of the two reviews. Discussion and conclusions: The noteddiscrepancy could rely on a limitation of the MARGOT system that can be improved;yet, the level of agreement between human reviewers also suggests a differentcomplexity between the two reviews in debating controversial arguments. Thesepreliminary results encourage to expand and deepen the investigation to othertopics and a larger number of highly specialized reviewers, to reduce uncertaintyin the evaluation process, thus supporting the retraining of AM systems.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to elicit the stated job preferences of Chinesemedical staff in the post-pandemic era and identify the relative importance ofdifferent factors in the practice environment. Methods: We used an onlinediscrete choice experiment (DCE) survey instrument to elicit the job preferences of medical staff (doctors and nurses) in tertiary hospitals in Anhui, China.Attributes and levels were generated using qualitative methods, and fourattributes were considered: career development, workload, respect from society,and monthly income. A set of profiles was created using a D-efficient design. Thedata were analyzed considering potential preference heterogeneity, using theconditional logit model and the latent class logit (LCL) model. Results: A total of 789 valid questionnaires were included in the analysis, with an effectiveresponse rate of 73.33%. Career development, workload, respect from society, and monthly income were significant factors that influenced job preferences. Threeclasses were identified based on the LCL model, and preference heterogeneityamong different medical staff was demonstrated. Class 1 (16.17%) and Class 2(43.51%) valued respect from society most, whereas Class 3 (40.32%) prioritizedmonthly income. We found that when respect from society was raised to asatisfactory level (50-75% positive reviews), the probability of medical staffchoosing a certain job increased by 69.9%. Conclusion: Respect from society wasthe most preferred attribute, while workload, monthly income, and careerdevelopment were all key factors in the medical staff's job choices. Theheterogeneity of the medical professionals' preferences shows that effectivepolicy interventions should be customized to accommodate these drive preferences.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly impactedhealthcare, especially the nursing field. This study aims to explore the current status and hot topics of nursing-related research on COVID-19 using bibliometric analysis. Methods: Between 2019 and 2022, publications regarding nursing andCOVID-19 were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection. We conducted an advanced search using the following search query string: TS = ("Novel coronavirus2019" or "Coronavirus disease 2019" or "COVID 19" or "2019-nCOV" or "SARS-CoV-2" or "coronavirus-2") and TS = ("nursing" or "nurse" or "nursing-care" or"midwife"). Bibliometric parameters were extracted, and Microsoft Excel 2010 and VOSviewer were utilized to identify the largest contributors, including prolific authors, institutions, countries, and journals. VOSviewer and CiteSpace were usedto analyze the knowledge network, collaborative maps, hotspots, and trends inthis field. Results: A total of 5,267 papers were published between 2020 and2022. The findings are as follows: the USA, China, and the UK are the top threeprolific countries; the University of Toronto, the Harvard Medical School, theJohns Hopkins University, and the Huazhong University of Science & Technology arethe top four most productive institutions; Gravenstein, Stefan, and White,Elizabeth M. from Brown University (USA) are the most prolific authors; TheInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health is the mostproductive journal; "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "nurse," "mental health," "nursing home," "nursing education," "telemedicine," "vaccine-related issues" are thecentral topics in the past 2 years. Conclusion: Nursing-related research onCOVID-19 has gained considerable attention worldwide. In 2020, the major hottopics included "SARS-CoV-2," "knowledge," "information teaching," "mentalhealth," "psychological problems," and "nursing home." In 2021 and 2022,researchers were also interested in topics such as "nursing students,""telemedicine," and "vaccine-related issues," which require furtherinvestigation.

TI  - Did States With More Social Capital Pre-pandemic Offer Mental Health ProtectionDuring the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Cross-Sectional View.
PG  - 947569
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.947569 [doi]
AB  - Background: Social capital is a well-known health determinant with bothrelational and geographic aspects. It can help mitigate adverse events and hasbeen shown to impact behaviors and responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mentalhealth has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, and social capital, may serveto buffer those declines. Methods: Building from this, we assessed whetherpre-pandemic social capital and contemporaneous social policy, which includedindicators of social trust, civic participation, and presence of mask mandates,affected pandemic mental health, measured as the percent of the populationexperiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety at the state level. Results:Generalized social trust and state mask mandates were significantly associatedwith lower levels of depression and anxiety. Conversely, states with greatercivic engagement prior to the pandemic experienced more anxiety and depression.Conclusions: Findings suggest that existing social capital, particularly socialtrust, may protect against anxiety and depression and contribute to communityresilience during times of adversity. States should invest in policies andprograms that increase social trust.

AB  - Background: Systemic immunosuppression characterizing cancer patients represents a concern regarding the efficacy of anti-severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination, and real-world evidence is needed todefine the efficacy and the dynamics of humoral immune response to mRNA-basedanti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Methods: We conducted an observational study thatincluded patients with solid tumors who were candidates for mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy. The primary objective was to monitor the immunologic response to the mRNAanti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in terms of anti-spike antibody levels. All thepatients received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the BNT162b2 vaccine.Healthcare workers served as a control group of healthy subjects. Results: Among the 243 patients included in the present analysis, 208 (85.60%) and 238 (97.94%) resulted seroconverted after the first and the second dose of vaccine,respectively. Only five patients (2.06%) had a negative titer after the seconddose. No significant differences in the rate of seroconversion after two vaccine doses were observed in patients as compared with the control group of healthysubjects. Age and anticancer treatment class had an independent impact on theantibody titer after the second dose of vaccination. In a subgroup of 171patients with available data about the third timepoint, patients receivingimmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors seem to have a higher peak ofantibodies soon after the second dose (3 weeks after), but a more pronounceddecrease at a late timepoint (3 months after). Conclusions: The systemicimmunosuppression characterizing cancer patients did not seem to dramaticallyaffect the humoral response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in our population ofpatients with solid tumors. Further investigation is needed to dissect theinterplay between immunotherapy and longitudinal dynamics of humoral response to mRNA vaccines, as well as to analyze the cellular response to mRNA vaccines incancer patients.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic has a high impact on the health of pregnant womenand healthcare providers worldwide. Objective: This study aims to assessmidwives' knowledge and preparedness in providing maternity care during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical hospital-based study thatincluded 116 midwives, who were working in labor ward, was conducted in theDodoma region of Tanzania from March to June 2021. The Chi-square test andFisher's exact test were used to assess the association between the categoricalvariables. The predictors of midwives' knowledge and preparedness were determinedusing binary logistic regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performedusing SPSS version 23.0; p < .05 was considered to be significant. Results: Ofthe midwives studied, 63 (54.3%) had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 and only30 (25.9%) were adequately prepared on provision of maternal care. Havingdiploma/bachelor level of education (AOR = 2.62, 95%CI = 1.08-6.36, p = .033),being trained on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI = 1.11-12.00, p = .033) and working in urban health facilities (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI = 1.17-13.98, p = .002) were thesignificant determinants of midwives' knowledge on COVID-19. Working at a health center (AOR = 0.19, 95%CI = 0.03-1.32. p = .033), being trained on COVID-19 (AOR = 0.04, 95%CI = 0.01-0.14, p = .000 and having adequate knowledge on COVID-19(AOR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.03-1.32, p = .032) were determinants of midwives'preparedness on provision of maternal care. Conclusion: Knowledge andpreparedness in the provision of maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic werelow. Emphasis should be put on training midwives on IPC when providing maternity care. This may help in preventing the spread of infectious diseases includingCOVID-19 as we observed in the present study.

LID - 10.2147/JIR.S375494 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a multi-organ and multi-system diseasewith high morbidity and mortality in severe cases due to respiratory failure and severe cardiovascular events. However, the various manifestations of neurologicaland psychiatric (N/P) systems of COVID-19 should not be neglected. Some clinical studies have reported a high risk of N/P disorders in COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients and that their outcomes were positively associated with the diseaseseverity. These clinical manifestations could attribute to direct SARS-CoV-2invasion into the central nervous system (CNS), which is often complicated bysystemic hypoxia, the dysfunctional activity of the renin-angiotensin system and other relevant pathological changes. These changes may remain long term and mayeven lead to persistent post-COVID consequences on the CNS, such as memory,attention and focus issues, persistent headaches, lingering loss of smell andtaste, enduring muscle aches and chronic fatigue. Mild confusion and coma areserious adverse outcomes of neuropathological manifestations in COVID-19patients, which could be diversiform and vary at different stages of the clinicalcourse. Although lab investigations and neuro-imaging findings may help quantify the disease's risk, progress and prognosis, large-scale and persistentmulticenter clinical cohort studies are needed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19on the N/P systems. However, we used "Boolean Operators" to search for relevantresearch articles, reviews and clinical trials from PubMed and the ClinicalTrialsdataset for "COVID-19 sequelae of N/P systems during post-COVID periods" with thetime frame from December 2019 to April 2022, only found 42 in 254,716COVID-19-related articles and 2 of 7931 clinical trials involved N/P sequelaeduring post-COVID periods. Due to the increasing number of infected cases and theincessant mutation characteristics of this virus, diagnostic and therapeuticguidelines for N/P manifestations should be further refined.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid-growing interest in theinvestigation of the human microbiota of the upper airways. In fact, the residentmicrobial community of this body district may have an influence on the onset ofSARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical course in terms of presence, symptomseverity, and outcomes. However, several microbiological methodologies areavailable to study the human microbiota, reflecting the extensive fragmentationof methodological approaches. We investigate the impact of two critical stepsthat can induce biases in the downstream analyses, i.e. sampling method andmicrobial DNA extraction kit employed. We observed major discrepancies regarding the total amount of prokaryotic DNA that could be retrieved from a biologicalsample and the proportion between bacterial DNA and human host DNA. Moreover,shotgun DNA sequencing and taxonomic profile reconstruction also revealedcorrelations between sampling methods and the procedures applied for microbialDNA extraction. Based on all the data collected in this study, we formulateindications regarding the most efficient and reliable methodological proceduresfor the metagenomic analyses of the upper airways' microbiota to maximizeaccuracy and reproducibility.

AB  - How should we think about crime deterrence in times of pandemics? The economicanalysis of crime tells us that potential offenders will compare the costs andthe benefits from crime and from innocence and then choose whichever option ismore profitable. We must therefore ask ourselves how this comparison is affected by the outbreak of a pandemic and the policy changes which may accompany it, suchas governmental restrictions, social distancing, and responses to economiccrises. Using insights from law and economics, this paper investigates how thevarious components in the cost-benefit analysis of crime might change during apandemic, focusing on Covid-19 as a test case. Building on classical theoretical models, existing empirical evidence, and behavioral aspects, the analysis revealsthat there are many potentially countervailing effects on crime deterrence. Thepaper thus highlights the need to carefully consider which aspects are applicablegiven the circumstances of the pandemic, as whether crime deterrence willincrease or decrease should depend on the strength of the effects at play.

AB  - Background: Early mobilization in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a hotspot.This study aims to provide a bibliometric perspective of the progress in thisfield. Methods: We extracted publications on ICU early mobilization published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2000 to 2021. VOSviewer was usedto construct co-occurrence and co-citation relationships for authors, references,and keywords; Citespace was used to visualize knowledge mapping of subjectcategories, countries, and keywords with the strongest citation bursts. Results: A total of 4,570 publications were analyzed, with a steady increase inpublications in the field of ICU early mobilization. From a macro perspective,research on ICU early mobilization involves multidisciplinary involvement,including critical care medicine, neurology, and nursing; as for the mesoperspective, the United States is the major contributor. Needham DM andSchweickert WD are the key researchers in this field. Moreover, the core journal is Critical Care Medicine, with the most publications and citations. Themicroscopic level, dominated by references and keywords, illustrates that thehotspot and frontier of research on ICU early mobilization focus on ICU-acquired weakness, delirium, the prognosis of critical illness, and severe COVID-19.Conclusion: This study presents a research landscape of ICU early mobilizationfrom different perspectives. These findings will contribute to a betterunderstanding of the current state of research in critical care medicine andprovide the available information for future research ideas.

LID - e21.00107 [pii]
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.OA.21.00107 [doi]
AB  - Historically, medical students often match within the same geographic location orto an orthopaedic surgery residency program affiliated with their medical school.The objective of this investigation was to determine differences in geographictrends between orthopaedic residents matching before and during theCoronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This study analyzed 2 groups oforthopaedic residents: Pre-COVID cohort (years 2016-2020) and COVID-impactedcohort (year 2021). A list of accredited orthopaedic surgery residency programs(n = 202) was obtained. Orthopaedic residency program webpages were located(region [n = 4], division [n = 9], state [n = 50]). For each resident, theirmedical school and year of postgraduate training were recorded. Year 2021resident information was obtained from the orthopaedic residency programwebpages, social media accounts, and medical school match lists. Residencyprograms affiliated with a medical school were also assigned. Descriptivestatistics were performed. Two sample Student t tests with Bonferroni correction applied to p-values (alpha < 0.05 significant) were performed. RESULTS: Therewere 4,832 residents analyzed (4,074 in Pre-COVID cohort; 758 in COVID-impactedcohort [758/868 of all positions in 2021 Match]). Statistically significantdifferences were detected between the COVID-impacted cohort (39.6%, p < 0.001)matching in the same state as their medical school (Pre-COVID 33.1%) and theCOVID-impacted cohort (28.0%, p < 0.001) matching to a residency programaffiliated with their medical school (Pre-COVID 21.2%). In the COVID-impactedcohort, students who matched in state matched to their home program morefrequently (69.3%) compared with the Pre-COVID cohort (60.5%). Geographically,there was a difference in the COVID-impacted cohort (52.5%, p < 0.011) matchingin the same division (Pre-COVID 47.5%). No statistically significant differences were identified for residents matching to the same region as their medical school(Pre-COVID 60.1%; COVID-impacted 61%, p = 0.968). CONCLUSION: Residents matching in the same state, in the same division, and to a residency program affiliatedwith their medical school increased significantly in the COVID-impacted cohort.There was no difference between cohorts matching in the same region as theirmedical school. Level of Evidence: Observational/Cross-Sectional.

AB  - The second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused severe infectionswith high mortality. An increase in the cases of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis(CAM) was reported predominantly in India. Commonly present in immunocompromised individuals, mucormycosis is often a life-threatening condition. Confoundingfactors and molecular mechanisms associated with CAM are still not wellunderstood, and there is a need for careful research in this direction. In thisreview, a brief account of the diagnosis, management, and advancement in drugdiscovery for mucormycosis has been provided. Here, we summarize major factorsthat dictate the occurrence of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients through theanalysis of published literature and case reports. Major predisposing factors to mucormycosis appear to be uncontrolled diabetes, steroid therapy, and certaincancers. At the molecular level, increased levels of iron in COVID-19 mightcontribute to mucormycosis. We have also discussed the potential role andregulation of iron metabolism in COVID-19 patients in establishing fungal growth.Other factors including diabetes prevalence and fungal spore burden in India ascontributing factors have also been discussed.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a constant threat to human beings and the world economy for more than two years. Vaccination is the first choice tocontrol and prevent the pandemic. However, an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccineagainst the virus infection is still needed. This study designed and preparedfour kinds of virus-like particles (VLPs) using an insect expression system. Two constructs encoded wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) fused with or without H5N1matrix 1 (M1) (S and SM). The other two constructs contained a codon-optimizedspike gene and/or M1 gene (mS and mSM) based on protein expression, stability,and ADE avoidance. The results showed that the VLP-based vaccine could inducehigh SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in mice, including specific IgG, IgG1, andIgG2a. Moreover, the mSM group has the most robust ability to stimulate humoralimmunity and cellular immunity than the other VLPs, suggesting the mSM is thebest immunogen. Further studies showed that the mSM combined with Al/CpG adjuvantcould stimulate animals to produce sustained high-level antibodies and establish an effective protective barrier to protect mice from challenges withmouse-adapted strain. The vaccine based on mSM and Al/CpG adjuvant is a promisingcandidate vaccine to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: Although coronavirus disease 2019 is causing a variety ofpsychological problems for workers, there are few longitudinal studies on changesin workers' mental health by workplace intervention. This study aimed to evaluatethe change in the prevalence of depression and anxiety according to the activeinvolvement of the workplace. Methods: This study was conducted on 1,978 workers at a workplace who underwent a health screening from January 2019 to August 2020,and classified depression and anxiety disorders using a self-reportquestionnaire. After the first pandemic, the company stopped health screening,took paid leave and telecommuting, and conducted interventions such as operating its own screening clinic. To see if this workplace intervention affects workers' mental health, we conducted generalized estimating equations to compare oddsratio (OR). Results: In the pre-intervention group, 384 people (16.86%) haddepression, and 507 people (22.26%) had anxiety disorder. Based on the OR before intervention, the OR of depression decreased to 0.76 (0.66-0.87) and the OR ofanxiety disorder decreased to 0.73 (0.65-0.82). Conclusions: As a result of this study, it was confirmed that workplace intervention was related to a decrease in depression and anxiety. This study provides basic data to improve workers' mentalhealth according to workplace intervention, and further research is neededaccording to workplace intervention in the future.

AB  - Background: Children and adolescents seem to be less affected by the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease in terms of severity,especially until the increasing spread of the omicron variant in December 2021.Anatomical structures and lower number of exhaled aerosols may in part explainthis phenomenon. In a cohort of healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected children, wecompared exhaled particle counts to gain further insights about the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: In this single-center prospectiveobservational trial, a total of 162 children and adolescents (age 6-17 years), ofwhom 39 were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 123PCR-negative, were included. The 39 PCR-positive children were compared to 39PCR-negative age-matched controls. The data of all PCR-negative children wereanalyzed to determine baseline exhaled particle counts in children. In addition, medical and clinical history was obtained and spirometry was measured. Results:Baseline exhaled particle counts were low in healthy children. Exhaled particlecounts were significantly increased in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive children (median355.0/L; range 81-6955/L), compared to age-matched -negative children (median157.0/L; range 1-533/L; p < 0.001). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive children exhaled significantly higher levels of aerosols than healthy children. Overallchildren had low levels of exhaled particle counts, possibly indicating thatchildren are not the major driver of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) clinical manifestations in children and adolescents are diverse, despite the respiratory condition being themain presentation. Factors such as comorbidities and other respiratory infectionsmay play a role in the initial presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aims to describe theepidemiological aspects, clinical, and laboratory manifestations of pediatricpatients admitted to a tertiary pediatric hospital in Rio de Janeiro, diagnosedwith COVID-19, and compare these with other viral conditions during the firstyear of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: All patients under 18 years of age thatwere admitted with upper airway infection were enrolled and followed up for 30days. The main dependent variable was the laboratorial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2,and independent variables were studied through logistic regression. Results: Atotal of 533 patients were recruited, and 105 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Detection of other viruses occurred in 34% of 264 tested participants. Sixpatients died (two in SARS-CoV-2 infected group). The variables independentlyassociated with COVID-19 were older age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0-1.1), lowerleukocytes count at entry (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-0.9), and contact withsuspected case (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.0-2.6). Patients with COVID-19 presentedhigher odds to be admitted in an intensive care unit (OR = 1.99, 95% CI =1.08-3.66). Conclusions: Even during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several otherrespiratory viruses were present in admitted pediatric patients. Variablesassociated with COVID-19 infection were older age, lower leukocytes count atentry, and a domiciliary suspect contact. Although patients with COVID-19 weremore frequently admitted to ICU, we did not observe higher mortality in thisgroup.

AB  - Graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) biosensors exhibit high sensitivity dueto a large surface-to-volume ratio and the high sensitivity of the Fermi level tothe presence of charged biomolecules near the surface. For most reported GFETbiosensors, bulky external reference electrodes are used which prevent theirfull-scale chip integration and contribute to higher costs per test. In thisstudy, GFET arrays with on-chip integrated liquid electrodes were employed forCOVID-19 detection and functionalized with either antibody or aptamer toselectively bind the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. In the case of theaptamer-functionalized GFET (aptasensor, Apt-GFET), the limit-of-detection (LOD) achieved was about 10(3) particles per mL for virus-like particles (VLPs) inclinical transport medium, outperforming the Ab-GFET biosensor counterpart. Inaddition, the aptasensor achieved a LOD of 160 aM for COVID-19 neutralizingantibodies in serum. The sensors were found to be highly selective, fast(sample-to-result within minutes), and stable (low device-to-device signalvariation; relative standard deviations below 0.5%). A home-built portablereadout electronic unit was employed for simultaneous real-time measurements of12 GFETs per chip. Our successful demonstration of a portable GFET biosensingplatform has high potential for infectious disease detection and otherhealth-care applications.

AB  - There have been multiple reports of the development of de novo or relapse ofglomerular diseases after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. While most of them haveoccurred with the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna/NIAID), there alsohave been reports associated with the vector vaccines (AstraZeneca/ChAdOx1-S)vaccine and the inactivated vaccines. Minimal change disease (MCD) is one of the more common glomerular diseases noted to have been associated with the COVID-19vaccination. We report here 4 more cases of MCD occurring in association with theCOVID-19 vaccine, 3 were de novo cases, and 1 case had a relapse of MCD. We also review all the 41 cases described thus far in the literature and review potentialcommon pathways activated by the vaccination that play a role in the pathogenesisof MCD.

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global crisis. Inthe immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an excessiveinflammatory response in patients, causing an inflammatory cytokine storm insevere cases. Cytokine storm leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome,pulmonary and other multiorgan failure, which is an important cause of COVID-19progression and even death. Among them, activation of inflammatory pathways is a major factor in generating cytokine storms and causing dysregulated immuneresponses, which is closely related to the severity of viral infection.Therefore, elucidation of the inflammatory signaling pathway of SARS-CoV-2 isimportant in providing otential therapeutic targets and treatment strategiesagainst COVID-19. Here, we discuss the major inflammatory pathways in thepathogenesis of COVID-19, including induction, function, and downstreamsignaling, as well as existing and potential interventions targeting thesecytokines or related signaling pathways. We believe that a comprehensiveunderstanding of the regulatory pathways of COVID-19 immune dysregulation andinflammation will help develop better clinical therapy strategies to effectively control inflammatory diseases, such as COVID-19.

AB  - The current study sought to characterize commentary regarding intimate partnerviolence during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic via the Twitter hashtags#DomesticAbuse and #DomesticViolence. A sample of 481 original, English-language tweets containing the hashtag #DomesticAbuse or #DomesticViolence posted acrossfive consecutive weekdays from March 22 to March 27, 2020-during which manyplaces were enacting lockdown mandates-was examined using thematic contentanalyses. Overall, Twitter users commented on potential increased rates of IPV,while adding details about abuse tactics that could be employed by perpetratorsduring the pandemic. Additionally, Twitter users disclosed personal experiencesof IPV victimization. Four themes were identified, including (1) type of domesticviolence (i.e. whether the violence was COVID-specific or general domesticviolence), (2) commentary about IPV (i.e. general reflections, decentralizing andcentralizing survivorhood), (3) perpetrator tactic (i.e. abuse tactic used by theperpetrator), and (4) institutions responsible (i.e. institutions responsible forproviding services to survivors). Overall, the commentary on Twitter reflected aneffort to raise awareness and share informational aid for potentialvictims/survivors of IPV. Data highlight the potential of social media networksin conveniently facilitating the sharing and spreading of useful resources toother users. Future research should examine whether resources shared via Twitter reach individuals who need them and empower individuals to garner support.

AB  - Frictions between work and family life have increased during the COVID-19pandemic, causing negative consequences on the mental health and quality of life of workers. Without validated instruments, it is not possible to determine theimpact of Work-Family and Family-Work conflict. To date, no studies have beenconducted to provide evidence of the validity and reliability of The SurveyWork-Home Interaction Nijmegen (SWING; 22 items) in the population of Argentineworkers. The SWING was administered to 611 Argentine workers of both sexes (73.6%female) aged between 18 and 70 years (M = 35.33; SD = 9.16) selected from anon-probabilistic accidental sampling. The confirmatory factor analysis showedsatisfactory fit indices of the original four-factor model (chi2 = 647.073, gl = 203, CFI = 0.93, GFI = 0.92, NFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.05,AIC = 557.9, BIC = 821.5). The level of reliability was acceptable (alpha between0.68 and 0.86, omega = 0.79-0.89). The relationships of the subscale scores with the engagement and burnout variables were as expected according to previousstudies. Having an instrument adequately adapted to the population of Argentineworkers facilitates the development of studies aimed at evaluating the role ofW-F or F-W interactions and their implications for health and productivity.

AB  - Objective: This paper studies the mediating and interactive effects of socialcapital on psychological capital and the feeling of happiness from the impact of COVID-19. Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on people'smental health and affected their hopes for the future. Lifestyle and economicconditions have also been affected and have subsequently impacted people's sense of confidence in life. This could increase the likelihood of many peopledeveloping mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. Therefore, it is vital to study the influence of psychological capital and social capital onpeople's subjective psychology and happiness experiences. Materials and Methods: Using an ordered probit model, this paper studied the independent influence andinteraction between psychological capital and social capital on people'shappiness. The ordered probit model was chosen because subjective well-being(SWB) is an ordered variable. We further used structural equation modeling (SEM) to study the mediating effects of social capital on psychological capital andhappiness. Results: The regression results showed that both psychological capitaland social capital were significantly positively correlated with happiness whencontrolling for other factors. In addition, psychological and social capitalsignificantly interacted, in which the psychological capital promotes the effect of social capital on happiness. Moreover, the effect of psychological capital on happiness was greater than that of social capital, demonstrating that happinessis more greatly influenced by subjective psychological experience. Theinteraction coefficient of psychological and social capital was also significant,showing that the two have mutually reinforcing effects on happiness. Finally,health, income class, real estate, stranger trust, age, and urban householdregistration had significant positive effects on happiness, while the view ofmoney, being female, education had a negative relationship with happiness. TheSEM results showed that the mediating effect of psychological capital onhappiness was partly transmitted through social capital: the total effect ofpsychological capital on happiness was highly significant (p < 0.0001), as wasthe total effect of social capital on happiness (p < 0.0001); however, thecoefficient for psychological capital was greater than that for social capital.Through heterogeneity analysis, we found that the relationship betweenpsychological capital, social capital, and happiness was significantly positivein each sub-sample group. There was also a significant interaction betweenpsychological and social capital for men, women, urban and rural residents, andhigher education background sample groups. However, the interaction was notsignificant in the sample group without higher education. In addition, therelationship between the happiness of rural residents and their educationalbackground and gender was not significant. Conclusion: We found thatpsychological and social capital have significant positive relationships andeffects on happiness. Psychological capital demonstrated both direct and indirectinfluences on happiness, and further strengthens the influence of social capital on happiness. These results support a scheme to emphasize psychological supportduring the COVID-19 pandemic period to enhance the mental health of citizens.

AB  - The global widespread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused shortage of medical face masks and led to developing of various types of cloth masks with different levels of protection and comfort to meet the market demands. Breathing comfort is a significant aspect that should be considered during the design ofcloth masks along with the filtration efficiency; otherwise, the wearer will feelsuffocated. In this work, different types of cotton and polyester knitted fabricsblended with spandex yarns were produced and treated with silver nanoparticles tobe used as antiviral cloth masks. Scanning electron microscope, transmissionelectron microscope, and EDX were used to characterize the silver nanoparticles(AgNPs). Antiviral activity was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus as well. The influence of using different fabric materials, number of layers, and hybridlayers on their air permeability and breathability were investigated to evaluate the comfortability of the cloth masks. Physiological impacts of wearing the clothmasks were evaluated by measuring oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and heart rate of the wearers while doing various activities. The results indicated that AgNPshave low cytotoxicity and considerable efficiency in inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Adding spandex yarns with different count and ratios reduced the porosity and airpermeability of the fabrics. Moreover, the combination of three hybrid layers'mask made of polyester fabric in the outer layer with 100% cotton fabric in theinner layer showed high comfortability associated with high air permeability and breathability. Also, wearing these masks while doing activities showed nosignificant effect on blood oxygen saturation and heart rate of the wearers.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Hub Genes Regulating Autophagy in Patients WithSevere COVID-19.
PG  - 908826
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.908826 [doi]
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has currently developed into a worldwide threatto humankind. Importantly, patients with severe COVID-19 are believed to have ahigher mortality risk than those with mild conditions. However, despite theurgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies, the biological features and pathogenic mechanisms of severe COVID-19 are poorly understood. Methods: Here,peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from four patients with severeCOVID-19, four patients with mild COVID-19, and four healthy controls wereexamined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We conducted gene expression analysis andVenn diagrams to detect specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) inpatients with severe disease compared with those with mild conditions. GeneOntology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significantbiological processes, and protein-protein interaction networks were constructedto extract hub genes. These hub genes were then subjected to regulatorysignatures and protein-chemical interaction analysis for certain regulatorycheckpoints and identification of potent chemical agents. Finally, to demonstratethe cell type-specific expression of these genes, we performed single-cellRNA-Seq analyses using an online platform. Results: A total of 144 DEGs werespecifically expressed in severe COVID-19, and GO enrichment analysis revealed a significant association of these specific DEGs with autophagy. Hub genes such as MVB12A, CHMP6, STAM, and VPS37B were then found to be most significantly involvedin the biological processes of autophagy at the transcriptome level. In addition,six transcription factors, including SRF, YY1, CREB1, PPARG, NFIC, and GATA2, as well as miRNAs, namely, hsa-mir-1-3p, and potent chemical agents such as coppersulfate and cobalt chloride, may cooperate in regulating the autophagy hub genes.Furthermore, classical monocytes may play a central role in severe COVID-19.Conclusion: We suggest that autophagy plays a crucial role in severe COVID-19.This study might facilitate a more profound knowledge of the biologicalcharacteristics and progression of COVID-19 and the development of noveltherapeutic approaches to achieve a breakthrough in the current COVID-19pandemic.

AB  - Since the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 at the genetic level would help combat COVID-19, particularly for long COVID. We performed a genetic analysis of ACE2 and searched for its common potential singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency >0.05 in bothEuropean and Chinese populations that would contribute to ACE2 gene expressionvariation. We thought that the variation of the ACE2 expression would be animportant biological feature that would strongly affect COVID-19 symptoms, suchas "brain fog", which is highlighted by the fact that ACE2 acts as a majorcellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and is highly expressed in braintissues. Based on the human GTEx gene expression database, we found rs2106809exhibited a significant correlation with the ACE2 expression among multiple brainand artery tissues. This expression correlation was replicated in an independent European brain eQTL database, Braineac. rs2106809*G also displays significantlyhigher frequency in Asian populations than in Europeans and displays a protectiveeffect (p = 0.047) against COVID-19 hospitalization when comparing hospitalizedCOVID-19 cases with non-hospitalized COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 test-negative sampleswith European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Furthermore, we experimentallydemonstrated that rs2106809*G could upregulate the transcriptional activity ofACE2. Therefore, integrative analysis and functional experiment strongly support that ACE2 SNP rs2106809 is a functional brain eQTL and its potential involvement in long COVID, which warrants further investigation.

TI  - Identification of antiviral peptide inhibitors for receptor binding domain ofSARS-CoV-2 omicron and its sub-variants: an in-silico approach.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1007/s13205-022-03258-4 [doi]
AB  - Omicron, a variant of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2, emerged in South Africa inNovember 2021. Omicron has been continuously acquiring a series of new mutations,especially in the spike (S) protein that led to high infectivity andtransmissibility. Peptides targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of thespike protein by which omicron and its variants attach to the host receptor,angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) can block the viral infection at the firststep. This study aims to identify antiviral peptides from the Antiviral peptidedatabase (AVPdb) and HIV-inhibitory peptide database (HIPdb) against the RBD ofomicron by using a molecular docking approach. The lead RBD binder peptidesobtained through molecular docking were screened for allergenicity andphysicochemical criteria (isoelectric point (pI) and net charge) required forpeptide-based drugs. The binding affinity of the best five peptide inhibitorswith the RBD of omicron was validated further by molecular dynamics (MD)simulation. Our result introduces five antiviral peptides, including AVP1056,AVP1059, AVP1225, AVP1801, and HIP755, that may effectively hinder omicron-hostinteractions. It is worth mentioning that all the three major sub-variants ofomicron, BA.1 (B.1.1.529.1), BA.2 (B.1.1.529.2), and BA.3 (B.1.1.529.3), exhibitsconserved ACE-2 interacting residues. Hence, the screened antiviral peptides withsimilar affinity can also interrupt the RBD-mediated invasion of different major sub-variants of omicron. Altogether, these peptides can be considered in thepeptide-based therapeutics development for omicron treatment after furtherexperimentation.

PG  - e26464
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26464 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary cavitation is an atypical finding in COVID-19 patients. In this rarecase report, a 63-year-old woman (35 days from COVID-19 symptom onset) presented to our emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Achest X-ray established right-sided total pneumothorax, hence a tube thoracostomywas performed. Due to a persistent air leak, chest computed tomography wasperformed, which showed areas of lung consolidation and a cavitary mass in theupper lobe of the right lung. The woman undertook a thoracoscopy, whichestablished multiple petechiae on the lung surface and a bronchopleural fistulaof the right lung's upper lobe. The treatment of choice was an atypical lungresection to remove the necrotic cavitary lesion. Histological andmicrobiological examination of the resected lung specimen showed a bland(aseptic) cavitary pulmonary infarct. Pulmonary infarction is a rare cause ofcavitation in COVID-19 patients, nonetheless, something that should be consideredin those presenting with respiratory symptoms or complications during orpost-COVID-19.

TI  - Boosting the Understanding and Approval of Anti-Corona Measures-ReducingExponential Growth Bias and its Effects through Educational Nudges.
PG  - 809-821
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12479 [doi]
AB  - One major problem of compliance with anti-coronavirus measures originates fromthe so-called exponential growth bias, i.e. the cognitive distortion ofsystematically underestimating exponential growth and its consequences. Wereplicate an Amazon MTurk experiment regarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that was conducted in the general US population during the first wave of the pandemic inMarch 2020 dealing with this bias. Using a least-likely-design-approach, we find a similarly strong bias in our sample of German students in November 2020.Nevertheless, this bias can be reduced by one simple educational intervention.Furthermore, participants who received these educational nudges showed aconsiderably higher approval rating for contact restrictions. This effect isrobust to different analytical techniques and the inclusion of controls.Complementing political statements about the exponential spread of the virus -which often only mention the name of the phenomenon - with simple educationalnudges could help the public better understand the need for encroachments onpersonal liberties.

TI  - Comparison of Clinical Profiles and Mortality Outcomes Between Influenza andCOVID-19 Patients Invasively Ventilated in the ICU: A Retrospective Study FromAll Paris Public Hospitals From 2016 to 2021.
PG  - e0737
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000737 [doi]
AB  - Studies comparing outcomes of ICU patients admitted for either COVID-19 orseasonal influenza are limited. Our objective was to describe baseline clinicalprofiles, care procedures, and mortality outcomes by infection status (influenza vs COVID-19) of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Data were extracted from the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris database from September 1, 2016, to April20, 2021. It includes data from the 39 university hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of752 influenza adult patients and 3,465 COVID-19 adult patients received invasive mechanical ventilation in one of the ICUs of the Paris area university hospitals,France. INTERVENTION: The characteristics and outcome by infection status werecompared. Factors associated with mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models after controlling for potential confounders, including infectionstatus. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The median age at admission to the ICU was67 (interquartile range [IQR], 57-77) and 63 yr (IQR, 54-71 yr) for influenza andCOVID-19 patients, respectively. At ICU admission, COVID-19 patients were morefrequently obese, more frequently had diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure,and were less likely to have chronic heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney failure, or active cancer than influenza patients. The overallsurvival at 90 days was 57% for COVID-19 patients and 66% for influenza patients (p < 0.001). In a multivariable Cox model, higher age, organ transplant, severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and chronic kidney failurewere associated with shorter survival, whereas obesity and high blood pressurewere associated with longer survival after invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS:COVID-19 and influenza patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICUdiffered by many characteristics. COVID-19 patients showed lower survivalindependently of potential confounders.

TI  - Adoption and Deadoption of Medications to Treat Hospitalized Patients WithCOVID-19.
PG  - e0727
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000727 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by rapidly evolving evidence regarding the efficacy of different therapies, as well as rapidly evolving healthpolicies in response to that evidence. Data on adoption and deadoption areessential as we learn from this pandemic and prepare for future public healthemergencies. DESIGN: We conducted an observational cohort study in which wedetermined patterns in the use of multiple medications to treat COVID-19:remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, IV corticosteroids, tocilizumab, heparin-basedanticoagulants, and ivermectin. We analyzed changes both overall and withinsubgroups of critically ill versus Noncritically ill patients. SETTING: Data fromOptum's deidentified Claims-Clinical Dataset, which contains multicenterelectronic health record data from U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 2020 to June 2021. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTSAND MAIN RESULTS: Of 141,533 eligible patients, 34,515 (24.4%) required admissionto an ICU, 14,754 (10.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 18,998 (13.4%)died during their hospitalization. Averaged over the entire time period,corticosteroid use was most common (47.0%), followed by remdesivir (33.2%),anticoagulants (19.3%), hydroxychloroquine (7.3%), and tocilizumab (3.4%). Usage patterns varied substantially across treatments. For example, hydroxychloroquine use peaked in March 2020 and leveled off to near zero by June 2020, whereas theuse of remdesivir, corticosteroids, and tocilizumab all increased following pressreleases announcing positive results of large international trials. Ivermectinuse increased slightly over the study period but was extremely rare overall(0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medication treatment patterns evolved reliably in response to emerging evidence and changes in policy. Thesefindings may inform efforts to promote optimal adoption and deadoption oftreatments for acute care conditions.

PG  - 16-38
LID - 10.32607/actanaturae.11652 [doi]
AB  - 1,4-Pyrazine-3-carboxamide-based antiviral compounds have been under intensivestudy for the last 20 years. One of these compounds, favipiravir(6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide, T-705), is approved for use againstthe influenza infection in a number of countries. Now, favipiravir is beingactively used against COVID-19. This review describes the in vivo metabolism offavipiravir, the mechanism of its antiviral activity, clinical findings, toxicproperties, and the chemical synthesis routes for its production. We provide dataon the synthesis and antiviral activity of structural analogs of favipiravir,including nucleosides and nucleotides based on them.

TI  - Risk Perception, Media, and Ordinary People's Intention to Engage inSelf-Protective Behaviors in the Early Stage of COVID-19 Pandemic in China.
PG  - 1459-1471
LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S374889 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study aims to examine how risk perception is associated withengagement in preventative behaviors and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: A cross-sectionalsurvey was conducted in February 2020, eventually obtaining 1613 participants,participants'risk perceptions, demographics (sex, age, education level, maritalstatus, and employment status), as well as their engagement in self-protectivebehaviors and testing were assessed. Results: Risk perception significantlyaffected intention to engage in self-protective behaviors, the more risk peoplefeel, the more likely they intend to take self-protective actions(beta =0.0423; P< 0.01), and simultaneously, people obtaining information on COVID-19 fromOfficial microblogs and public accounts(OMPA) (beta =0.189; P < 0.01)and Onlinewebsites(OW) (beta =0.143; P < 0.1)were more inclined to take self-protectivebehaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also showed that the interaction ofrisk perception and Online websites negatively affected the intention to engagein self-protective behaviors(beta = -0.0374; P < 0.05), and conversely, theinteraction of risk perception and Overseas media(OM) positively affectedself-protective intention(beta = 0.0423; P < 0.1). Conclusion: There was a close relationship between the risk perception and the intention to engage inself-protective behaviors. At the same time, the use of media not only directlyaffected the intention to engage in self-protective behaviors but also moderated the impact of risk perception on the self-protection intention. Specifically,official media directly strengthened the intention to engage in self-protectivebehaviors. Online websites not only directly affected self-protection intentionbut also moderated the effect of risk perception on it. Although overseas mediahad no direct effect on self-protection intention, they moderated the effect ofrisk perception on it. These conclusions have policy implications forgovernments' response to the COVID-19 epidemic.

LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S370125 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on thepsychological health and dental practice of oral health-care workers (OHCWs). Thesearch for relevant literature was carried out online using PubMed, Web ofscience, and science direct databases from January 2020 to February 2021. Thosearticles were included that provided complete information about the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic on oral health-care workers during covid-19 and were originalarticles and reviews. Those articles were excluded from the current study thatwas not in English Language and involved case reports/book chapters/shortcommunications. Finally, only 8 articles were selected for the scoping reviewconsidering that complete information regarding the provision of dental care inthe time of COVID-19 was provided. Increased psychological distress (especiallythose with existing comorbidities) was noted among the OHCWs during thispandemic. They had enough knowledge about COVID-19 and showed concern regardingthe future of dentistry. Either complete or partial closure of dental clinics hadintroduced financial constraints among them. However, the majority of them didnot switch their profession. The institutions were not prepared for any suchsituation and no training was conducted to control the spread of COVID-19infection. OHCWs are fully aware of the knowledge regarding COVID-19 and showedconcerns for dentistry and dental health-care workers during this pandemic.Complete or partial closure of dental clinics has had adverse effects on thefuture of dentistry, economically as well as psychologically. Institutions needto upgrade and strengthen their systems to cater to any such situationefficiently. Proper counseling sessions should be conducted for the OHCWs tomonitor, identify and treat the cases found.

TI  - Immune Thrombocytopenia in Previously Healthy Individuals Following SARS-CoV-2Vaccination (COVID-19 Immunization): A Descriptive Research of 70 Instances With a Focus on Biomarkers, Predictive Outcomes, and Consequences.
PG  - e26480
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26480 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is exacerbating the worldwidehealthcare crisis. The pandemic has had an impact on nearly every system of ourbody. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave immediate authorization ofseveral vaccines to avoid critical COVID-19 outcomes following the rapid spreadof the COVID-19. There have only been a few cases of severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination-induced immune thrombocytopenia(ITP) so far. There should be enough information to identify whether somevaccination adverse effects, such as ITP, are caused by the vaccine. This studyaims to determine how common ITP occurs after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,as well as gender, age, symptoms, biomarkers, predicted outcomes, and sequelae.We looked at a number of research and compiled the best evidence of SARS-CoV-2vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia currently available. To find the recommendedreporting items, the search technique included keywords like "Immunethrombocytopenia," "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," and "Vaccination." The searchresults were grouped using Boolean operators ("OR," "AND").

TI  - How Does the COVID-19 Pandemic Influence Histopathological Outcomes for Urologic Cancers?
PG  - e26500
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26500 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted all routinehealth care services and resulted in a significant reconfiguration of urologiccancer services and care pathways across the globe. This study aimed toretrospectively determine the pandemic's impact on the urologic oncologicalsurgery outcomes at a high-volume referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wecompared the number and histopathological outcomes of urologic oncologicalprocedures in a referral center coded during the pandemic and data of the period before the pandemic as control. Data were extracted from patient files andhospital records. The pathological examination included a completehistopathological staging according to TNM stage. RESULTS: A total of 683patients were included in the study, 424 (62%) of which were operated in thepre-pandemic period. There was a 39% decline in urologic oncological surgicalactivity in the pandemic, mostly in renal and prostate cancer. The mean tumorsize was larger in renal cancer patients who underwent surgery during thepandemic (5.6 cm vs 4.5 cm, p=0.002). During the pandemic, more lymph nodeinvolvement was seen after radical cystectomy and prostatectomy (50% vs 27.8%,p=0.024 and 12.5% vs 4.5%, p=0.026, respectively). No differences in terms ofmain pathologic features were observed in patients undergoing radicalorchiectomy. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appeared to adversely effect oncologic outcomesin patiens undergone surgery for prostate and bladder cancer. Tumor developmentinduced by a delay in diagnosis may cause severe consequences for patients.Reprioritizion of non-deferrable urologic oncological seems crucial.

AB  - The knowledge about COVID-19 infection and sequelae is evolving. Acuteeosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is not a well-recognized complication of COVID-19infection, with few cases reported in the literature. We report a case of a60-year-old male with a history of an orthotopic heart transplant on chronicimmunosuppression who had AEP three weeks after a COVID-19 infection. Hepresented with diarrhea and acute kidney injury without respiratory symptoms.After discharge, the patient experienced progressive fevers, dyspnea, and coughresulting in a second admission to the hospital with acute hypoxic respiratoryfailure requiring supplemental oxygen. Imaging demonstrated ground-glassopacities with areas of consolidation and bronchoalveolar lavage fluiddemonstrated AEP. The patient was treated with steroids resulting in theresolution of his symptoms and radiographic findings. This case highlights thepotential for AEP to complicate COVID-19 infections.

TI  - Grief experience among ICU staff with loss of family members during COVID-19outbreak in IRAN: A qualitative study.
PG  - 904760
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.904760 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 crisis created a lot of problems in people's lives.Different lifestyles, mental health, communication, rituals and traditions,particularly those involved in mourning, have changed drastically. Medical staff faced numerous critically ill patients every day. This greatly distressed thestaff, especially the ICU staff. The end result was considerable amounts ofmental distress for the medical staff who lost family members to COVID-19 making the distress even more complex. Methods: We carried out this qualitative researchto study the grief experiences of 12 Iranian ICU staff members at the RasoulAkram Hospital who had experienced the loss of a family member to the COVID-19pandemic. We studied the effects of how their own grief experience and howconstant exposure to critically ill patients influenced their work with patients.All semi-structured interviews were held in the presence of a faculty member ofthe psychiatry department of Iran University of Medical Sciences. The interviewon the grief experience among ICU staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, consists of4 issues: Familiarity, Experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, Grieving the lossof a family member and Effects of parallel grief. Results: We found five commonthemes in the result of the experiences of the participants based on contentanalysis. These consisted of: complex grieving process, new experiences forcoping with loss, more empathy for patients, change the meaning of death, and theneed for support in work places. Likewise, there were 22 sub themes. Conclusion: Paying attention to the details of staff members' life, gender differences, andcultural aspects can give us a better understanding and perception of their griefexperiences. This understanding brings out valuable points which can help policy makers pass better laws for the wellbeing of society and people in order topromote leadership in turbulent times.

PG  - 884600
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.884600 [doi]
AB  - Background: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) increased rapidly inthe last 20 years. Although related research has developed rapidly, little isknown about its etiology, diagnostic marker, or drug treatment, which forcesresearchers to review and summarize its development process and look for thefuture development direction. Methods: We used bibliometrics to analyze papers ofASD in the Web of Science from 1998 to 2021, to draw the network of authors,institutions, countries, and keywords in the ASD field, and visualize theresults. Results: A total of 40,597 papers were included with a continuallyincreasing trend. It turns out that the research on ASD is mainly concentrated inuniversities. The United States has the largest number of ASD studies, followedby England and Canada. The quality of papers related to ASD is generally high,which shows that ASD research has become a hot spot of scientific research. Thekeywords of ASD etiology and diagnostic markers can be classified into at least 7aspects. The detection of keywords shows that ASD research is mostly based on itssubtypes, takes children as the study population, focuses on neurodevelopmentalimaging or genetics, and pays attention to individual differences. And ASDresearch has changed greatly under the impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in thepast 2 years. Conclusion: We consider the future development direction should be based on the improvement of case identification, accurate clinical phenotype,large-scale cohort study, the discovery of ASD etiology and diagnostic markers,drug randomized controlled trials, and telehealth.

TI  - Use of Modeling to Inform Decision Making in North Carolina during the COVID-19Pandemic: A Qualitative Study.
PG  - 23814683221116362
LID - 10.1177/23814683221116362 [doi]
AB  - Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has popularized computer-based decision-supportmodels, which are commonly used to inform decision making amidst complexity.Understanding what organizational decision makers prefer from these models isneeded to inform model development during this and future crises. Methods. Werecruited and interviewed decision makers from North Carolina across 9 sectors tounderstand organizational decision-making processes during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 44). For this study, we identified and analyzed a subsetof responses from interviewees (n = 19) who reported using modeling to informdecision making. We used conventional content analysis to analyze themes fromthis convenience sample with respect to the source of models and theirapplications, the value of modeling and recommended applications, and hesitanciestoward the use of models. Results. Models were used to compare trends in disease spread across localities, estimate the effects of social distancing policies, andallocate scarce resources, with some interviewees depending on multiple models.Decision makers desired more granular models, capable of projecting diseasespread within subpopulations and estimating where local outbreaks could occur,and incorporating a broad set of outcomes, such as social well-being. Hesitanciesto the use of modeling included doubts that models could reflect nuances of humanbehavior, concerns about the quality of data used in models, and the limitedamount of modeling specific to the local context. Conclusions. Decision makersperceived modeling as valuable for informing organizational decisions yetdescribed varied ability and willingness to use models for this purpose. Thesedata present an opportunity to educate organizational decision makers on themerits of decision-support modeling and to inform modeling teams on how to build more responsive models that address the needs of organizational decision makers. Highlights: Organizations from a diversity of sectors across North Carolina(including public health, education, business, government, religion, and publicsafety) have used decision-support modeling to inform decision making duringCOVID-19.Decision makers wish for models to project the spread of disease,especially at the local level (e.g., individual cities and counties), and to helpestimate the outcomes of policies.Some organizational decision makers arehesitant to use modeling to inform their decisions, stemming from doubts thatmodels could reflect nuances of human behavior, concerns about the accuracy andprecision of data used in models, and the limited amount of modeling available atthe local level.

LID - 10.1148/ryai.210217 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To conduct a prospective observational study across 12 U.S. hospitals toevaluate real-time performance of an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI)model to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods: A total of 95 363 chest radiographs were included in model training, external validation,and real-time validation. The model was deployed as a clinical decision supportsystem, and performance was prospectively evaluated. There were 5335 totalreal-time predictions and a COVID-19 prevalence of 4.8% (258 of 5335). Modelperformance was assessed with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis, precision-recall curves, and F1 score. Logistic regression was used to evaluatethe association of race and sex with AI model diagnostic accuracy. To comparemodel accuracy with the performance of board-certified radiologists, a thirddataset of 1638 images was read independently by two radiologists. Results:Participants positive for COVID-19 had higher COVID-19 diagnostic scores thanparticipants negative for COVID-19 (median, 0.1 [IQR, 0.0-0.8] vs 0.0 [IQR,0.0-0.1], respectively; P < .001). Real-time model performance was unchanged over19 weeks of implementation (area under the receiver operating characteristiccurve, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.73). Model sensitivity was higher in men than women (P = .01), whereas model specificity was higher in women (P = .001). Sensitivity was higher for Asian (P = .002) and Black (P = .046) participants compared withWhite participants. The COVID-19 AI diagnostic system had worse accuracy (63.5%correct) compared with radiologist predictions (radiologist 1 = 67.8% correct,radiologist 2 = 68.6% correct; McNemar P < .001 for both). Conclusion: AI-basedtools have not yet reached full diagnostic potential for COVID-19 andunderperform compared with radiologist prediction.Keywords: Diagnosis,Classification, Application Domain, Infection, Lung Supplemental material isavailable for this article..

AB  - Not only Covid-19 has spread all over the world-the policies responding to thispandemic have also diffused rapidly across countries. In this research note, wepresent findings from an original dataset that features mobility restrictions in all EU/EFTA states as well as the United Kingdom during the first wave of thepandemic. We find that most countries adopted restrictions within a few days onlyand that restrictions on internal mobility had been introduced prior torestrictions on cross-border mobility, but that the latter have been morepersistent. Furthermore, we observe an evolution from great variation of policychoices at the outset of the pandemic towards convergence. Analyzing the mobilityrestrictions through a policy diffusion lens, we find tentative evidence forinterdependent policy-making especially in the temporal patterns of adoption. Ourresearch note can serve a basis for future research on policy-making and policydiffusion in times of crisis.

LID - 10.1111/spsr.12461 [doi]
AB  - With the arrival of vaccines against the novel coronavirus in late 2020, theissue of how vaccines should be distributed and which groups should beprioritized has become salient. We study popular attitudes toward thedistribution of COVID-19 vaccines and how these have changed over the course ofthe pandemic in Switzerland, drawing on data from two rounds of an originalpublic opinion survey conducted in the spring and winter of 2020. We find thatthe public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups such as health care workers orthe elderly. We also find a notable degree of cross-generational solidarity:younger age cohorts prioritize the elderly, while older groups prioritize(typically younger) health care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older agegroups, whose solidarity thus seems to be genuine. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue among younger groups, however.

AB  - We study the role of social media in debates regarding two policy responses toCOVID-19 in Switzerland: face-mask rules and contact-tracing apps. We use adictionary classifier to categorize 612'177 tweets by parties, politicians, andthe public as well as 441'458 articles published in 76 newspapers betweenFebruary and August 2020. We distinguish between "problem" (COVID-19) and"solutions" (face masks and contact-tracing apps) and, using a vectorautoregression approach, we analyze the relationship between their salience onsocial and traditional media, as well as among different groups on social media. We find that overall attention to COVID-19 was not driven by endogenous dynamics between the different actors. By contrast, the debate on face masks was led bythe attentive public and by politicians, whereas parties and newspapers followed.The results illustrate how social media challenge the capacity of party and mediaelites to craft a consensus regarding the appropriateness of different measuresas responses to a major crisis.

LID - 10.1111/spsr.12465 [doi]
AB  - International organizations such as the WHO have worked to raise awareness of themassive infodemic that accompanied the COVID-19 outbreak and made it hard forpeople to find trustworthy sources of information and reliable guidance for theirdecisions. Our contribution focuses on the Italian case, where the CommunicationsRegulatory Authority (AGCOM) was able to act as first mover in its field so as tostrategically frame the problem of disinformation in the absence of apre-existing policy intervention. An emerging body of research shows that theactivity of formally independent regulators is not necessarily limited to theimplementation of delegated regulatory competencies. We discuss the implications of the activity of independent regulators for the fight against disinformationduring the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that as a political actor in its own right,the Italian media regulator claimed control over sectoral expertise in order toshape the crucial first steps of the response to the infodemic.

PG  - 311-324
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12446 [doi]
AB  - Measures to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic have put a sudden halt to streetprotests and other forms of citizen involvement in Europe. At the same time, the pandemic has increased the need for solidarity, motivating citizens to becomeinvolved on behalf of people at risk and the vulnerable more generally. Thisresearch note empirically examines the tension between the demobilisation andactivation potential of the COVID-19 crisis. Drawing on original survey data fromseven Western European countries, we examine the extent, forms, and drivers ofcitizens' engagement. Our findings show the remarkable persistence ofpre-existing political and civic engagement patterns. Concurrently, we show that threat perceptions triggered by the multifaceted COVID-19 crisis have mobilizedEuropeans in the early phase of the pandemic. Similarly, the role of extremeideological orientations in explaining (regular) political engagement indicatesthat the current situation may create its specific mobilisation potentials.

PG  - 353-368
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12466 [doi]
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic severely threatens refugees: Most refugees live indeveloping countries with poor health care systems, the lockdowns left manyrefugees without income, border closures prevented forced migrants from theirright to seek asylum and anti-refugee sentiment as well as insecurity in refugee settlements increased. Building on past refugee research and reports onrefugee-related challenges during the Covid-19 crisis, we explain how badsanitation, inadequate accommodation, additional restrictions of movement andemployment and language barriers increase grievances among refugees and tensions between refugees and host populations. Particularly in large and overcrowdedsettlements these issues can lead to violent conflict, as we demonstrate with acase study of the Moria refugee camp in Greece. Yet, the impact of Covid-19 onrefugees generally lacks politicization, and many governments are reluctant orunable to provide adequate housing and sanitation to refugees. We present policy recommendations for improving refugee protection amidst Covid-19, including notonly the prevention of further spread of the virus but also that of insecurity.

LID - 10.1111/spsr.12457 [doi]
AB  - What is the effect of pandemics on partisan perceptions of government competence?Taking the case of Covid-19 in the UK, we explore how voters' assessments of the government's handling of the economy and health were affected by four events: thefirst UK Covid-19 death; the national lockdown; Boris Johnson's hospitalisation; and Cummings' scandal. Using a large representative weekly survey in the lastyear totalling over around 30'000 respondents, our results show that Labourvoters had the worst assessments of government handling. The first deathdeteriorated perceptions of government handling of health among both Labour andConservative voters, while Boris Johnson's hospitalisation improved perceptionsamong most voters. Lockdown improved the perception of health handling but at thecost of more negative perceptions of its handling of the economy. The Cummingsscandal had a negative effect on perceptions of government handling of economybut surprisingly improved perceptions of its handling of health.

AB  - Public opinion on COVID-19 provides new empirical evidence for the debate on the ideological contours of conspiracy theories. I report findings from a web survey in Greece where participants were recruited via paid advertising on Facebook and the study sample was adjusted for age, gender, education, domicile, and region ofresidence using a nationally representative reference sample. I find that beliefsabout conspiracy theories are more correlated than the values associated withestablished political ideologies, and that conspiracy beliefs and scepticismabout the pandemic are best explained by belief in unrelated political andmedical conspiracy theories. No other demographic or attitudinal variable hassuch a strong influence, and the results are robust to different statisticalspecifications. In comparison, the effect of ideology measured by left-rightself-placement is rather negligible and further moderated by trust in government.The results have implications for the strategies aimed at fighting disinformationduring public health emergencies.

PG  - 339-352
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12462 [doi]
AB  - Crises like the current coronavirus pandemic evoke negative emotions in thegeneral public. To date, however, little research has been conducted on theinfluence of these mental states on trust in the government - the uncontested keyplayer in times of crises. Drawing on the appraisal and affective intelligencetheories of emotions, we argue that fear and anger as the two crucial negativeemotions in times of crises have divergent effects on trust in the government:Whereas fear leads to a rally-'round-the-flag effect increasing trust in thegovernment, anger attributes blame for the adverse circumstances to thegovernment. We present empirical evidence for our arguments with an originalthree-wave online panel survey of 1'600 Swiss residents during the unprecedented times of the coronavirus pandemic. Our analysis provides empirical support forour arguments and further shows that the relationship is strongest for right-wingrespondents.

AB  - Background: An estimated 8 million people die every year due to tobacco use. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the health consequences of smoking, which is aleading risk factor for more severe COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization, anddeath. The pandemic has also led to reductions in physical activity, increases instress and declines in mental well-being, all factors commonly associated withtriggering higher tobacco use. Methods: Using a longitudinal data set ofpurchasing behavior from 2019-2020 among a national sample of the Danishpopulation (n = 4042), we estimate changes in tobacco use during the COVID-19pandemic. Our analysis compares tobacco purchases prior to the pandemic topurchases during the pandemic, at the individual level. We also examine effectswithin subgroups based on smoking behavior in 2019 prior to the pandemic. Weestimate effects for smokers and non-smokers and, within smokers, for occasional smokers and regular smokers. Results: We find large, sustained decreases intobacco purchases during COVID-19. We estimate that weekly tobacco purchase ratesdecline by 24% and average quantities decline by 12% during the period spanningthe onset of the pandemic in March 2020 through the end of the year. The declinesare driven by regular smokers with little change in behavior among nonsmokers andincreases in purchases among occasional smokers. Among regular smokers, purchase rates decline by about 30%, tobacco purchases decline by about 20% and quittingrates increase by about 10 percentage points. Conclusions: Our results suggestthat the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to sustained reductions in smoking.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has had an unprecedented impact on human health and highlights theneed for genomic epidemiology studies to increase our understanding of theevolution and spread of pathogens and to inform policy decisions. Most effortshave focused on international or country-wide transmission, which are unable tohighlight state-wide trends. We sequenced virus genomes from over 22,000 patientstested at Mayo Clinic Laboratories between 2020-2022 and leveraged detailedpatient metadata to describe county-to-county spread in Minnesota. Our findingsindicate that spread in the state was mostly dominated by viruses from HennepinCounty, which contains the largest metropolis. For many counties, we found thatstate government restrictions eventually led to a decrease in the diversity ofcirculating viruses from other counties and that their complete removal in May of2021 saw a drastic revert to levels at or greater than those observed during the months before. We also linked over 14,000 genomes with patient riskcharacteristics and infection-related phenotypes from the Mayo Clinic electronic health record. We found that the genetic relationship of Omicron viruses wasstructured by clinical outcomes when stratifying by patient risk factor andvariant of concern. However, we were unable to identify nucleotide variants that drove this association.

AB  - Both private and public benefits result from vaccination for transmissiblediseases, such as seasonal influenza, measles, and COVID-19. To help informvaccination efforts for such diseases, we ask whether social preferences-concernsfor the well-being of other people-influence one's decision regardingvaccination. We measure these social preferences for 549 online subjects: We giveeach subject $4 to play a public-good game and make contributions to publicwelfare. To the extent that one gets vaccinated out of concern for the health of others, contribution in this game is analogous to an individual's decision toobtain vaccination. We proxy vaccine demand with individuals' delay to initially vaccinate for COVID-19. We collect COVID-19 vaccination history separately toavoid experimenter-demand effects. We find a strong result: Contribution in thepublic-good game is associated with greater demand to voluntarily receive a firstdose, and thus also to vaccinate earlier. Compared to a subject who contributesnothing, one who contributes the maximum ($4) is 48% more likely to obtain afirst dose voluntarily in the four-month period that we study (April throughAugust 2021). People who are more pro-social are indeed more likely to take avoluntary COVID-19 vaccination. We thus recommend further research on the use of pro-social preferences to help motivate individuals to vaccinate fortransmissible diseases, such as the flu and HPV.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) global pandemic continuous to infect and kill millions while rapidly evolving new variants that are more transmissible and evadingvaccine-elicited antibodies. Artemisia annua L. extracts have shown potencyagainst all previously tested variants. Here we further queried extract efficacy against omicron and its recent subvariants. Using Vero E6 cells, we measured the in vitro efficacy (IC 50 ) of stored (frozen) dried-leaf hot-water A. annua L.extracts of four cultivars (A3, BUR, MED, and SAM) against SARS-CoV-2 variants:original WA1 (WT), BA.1.1.529+R346K (omicron), BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4. IC 50values normalized to the extract artemisinin (ART) content ranged from 0.5-16.5microM ART. When normalized to dry mass of the extracted A. annua leaves, values ranged from 20-106 microg. Although IC 50 values for these new variants areslightly higher than those reported for previously tested variants, they werewithin limits of assay variation. There was no measurable loss of cell viability at leaf dry weights </=50 microg of any cultivar extract. Results continue toindicate that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts (tea infusions)could potentially provide a cost-effective approach to help stave off thispandemic virus and its rapidly evolving variants.

LID - 10.1101/2020.05.29.123497 [doi]
AB  - Motivation: Integrating multimodal data represents an effective approach topredicting biomedical characteristics, such as protein functions and diseaseoutcomes. However, existing data integration approaches do not sufficientlyaddress the heterogeneous semantics of multimodal data. In particular, early and intermediate approaches that rely on a uniform integrated representationreinforce the consensus among the modalities, but may lose exclusive localinformation. The alternative late integration approach that can address thischallenge has not been systematically studied for biomedical problems. Results:We propose Ensemble Integration (EI) as a novel systematic implementation of the late integration approach. EI infers local predictive models from the individual data modalities using appropriate algorithms, and uses effective heterogeneousensemble algorithms to integrate these local models into a global predictivemodel. We also propose a novel interpretation method for EI models. We tested EI on the problems of predicting protein function from multimodal STRING data, andmortality due to COVID-19 from multimodal data in electronic health records. Wefound that EI accomplished its goal of producing significantly more accuratepredictions than each individual modality. It also performed better than several established early integration methods for each of these problems. Theinterpretation of a representative EI model for COVID-19 mortality predictionidentified several disease-relevant features, such as laboratory test (blood ureanitrogen (BUN) and calcium) and vital sign measurements (minimum oxygensaturation) and demographics (age). These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the EI framework for biomedical data integration and predictive modeling.Availability: Code and data are available athttps://github.com/GauravPandeyLab/ensemble_integration .

AB  - Objectives: To investigate relationships between race and COVID-19hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality over timeand which characteristics, may mediate COVID-19 associations. Methods: Weanalyzed hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and mortality among positiveCOVID-19 cases within the ten-hospital Franciscan Ministries of Our Lady HealthSystem around the Mississippi River Industrial Corridor in Louisiana over fourwaves of the pandemic from March 1, 2020 - August 31, 2021. Associations between race and each outcome were tested, and multiple mediation analysis was performed to test if other demographic, socioeconomic, or air pollution variables mediatethe race-outcome relationships. Results: Race was associated with each outcomeover the study duration and during most waves. Early in the pandemic,hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality rates were greater among Blackpatients, but as the pandemic progressed these rates became greater in Whitepatients. However, Black patients were still disproportionately represented inthese measures. Age was a significant mediator for all outcomes across waves,while comorbidity and emissions of naphthalene and chloroprene acted as mediatorsfor the full study period. Conclusions: The role of race evolved throughout thepandemic in Louisiana, but Black patients bore a disproportionate impact.Naphthalene and chloroprene air pollution partially explained the long-termassociations. Our findings imply that air pollution might contribute to theincreased COVID-19 hospitalizations and mortality among Black residents inLouisiana but likely do not explain most of the effect of race. What is alreadyknown on this topic: Early in the pandemic, there was evidence of disparities in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, andmortality due to race. Studies were emerging to indicate that strength of theserelationships was waning over time. What this study adds: This study testsrelationships between race and hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mortalityand finds that Black patients continue to be disproportionately represented,although that inequity diminished over time. This study, the first to usemultiple mediation analysis to study COVID-19 associations, suggests that therelationship between race and health outcome can be explained by mediatorsincluding age and, to a lesser extent, comorbidity and air pollution. How thisstudy might affect research practice or policy: This study supports the need for healthcare resources to be available to Louisiana's communities of color, forpolicy to support increased access to health care in the Industrial Corridorregion, and for policy to support the reduction of air pollution emissions todisproportionately impacting the health of the Industrial Corridor's communities of color.

AB  - As the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease started to spread rapidly in the stateof Ohio, the Ecology, Epidemiology and Population Health (EEPH) program withinthe Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) at the Ohio State University (OSU) tookthe initiative to offer epidemic modeling and decision analytics support to theOhio Department of Health (ODH). This paper describes the methodology used by theOSU/IDI response modeling team to predict statewide cases of new infections aswell as potential hospital burden in the state. The methodology has twocomponents: 1) A Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA)-based statistical method toperform parameter inference, statewide prediction and uncertainty quantification.2) A geographic component that down-projects statewide predicted counts topotential hospital burden across the state. We demonstrate the overallmethodology with publicly available data. A Python implementation of themethodology has been made available publicly. Highlights: We present a novelstatistical approach called Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA) to model an epidemic curve with incomplete data. The DSA approach is advantageous over standardstatistical methods primarily because it does not require prior knowledge of the size of the susceptible population, the overall prevalence of the disease, andalso the shape of the epidemic curve.The principal motivation behind the studywas to obtain predictions of case counts of COVID-19 and the resulting hospitalburden in the state of Ohio during the early phase of the pandemic.The proposedmethodology was applied to the COVID-19 incidence data in the state of Ohio tosupport the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and the Ohio Hospital Association(OHA) with predictions of hospital burden in each of the Hospital Catchment Areas(HCAs) of the state.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has negative impacts on mental health in all populations.Individuals with a history of cancer have an increased risk of catching andhaving more severe symptoms of COVID-19 than the general public. The objective ofthis study was to examine how cancer history and concern for catching COVID-19relate to anxiety. Methods: This cross-sectional study is part of the "Impact of COVID-19 on Behaviors across the Cancer Control Continuum in Ohio" projectconducted from June to November 2020. The sample consisted of 7012 participantswho completed survey online, by phone, or by mail. Self-reported concern forcatching COVID-19 and anxiety over the last 7 days were used. Linear and logisticregression models were performed to determine the association betweendemographics, cancer history, concern for catching COVID-19, and anxiety.Results: In our study sample, most participants rated their concern for catching COVID-19 as moderately high or high (56%) and reported anxiety for one day ormore (63%). Individuals with a cancer history were more likely to reportmoderate-high or high concern for catching COVID-19 (59% vs.54%, P<0.001) butless likely to report anxiety (58% vs. 67%, P<0.001) compared to those without a cancer history. Individuals with higher SES were less likely to report anxiety(middle vs. low SES: OR=0.68, 95%CI=0.59-0.79; high vs. low SES: OR=0.70,95%CI=0.61-0.82). Additionally, increased concern for catching COVID-19 wasassociated with higher likelihood of reporting anxiety (moderate-low vs. low:OR=1.65, 95%CI=1.42-1.92; moderate-high vs. low: OR=2.98, 95%CI=2.53-3.50; highvs. low: OR=4.35, 95%CI=3.74-5.07). Conclusions: Our findings suggest individualswith a cancer history reported higher concern for catching COVID-19. Higherconcern for catching COVID was associated with anxiety. These findings indicatethat healthcare providers should pay special attention to the differentpopulations to reduce concerns for catching COVID-19 and provide strategies toimprove mental health during a pandemic outbreak.

AB  - Background: We evaluated how temporary disruptions to primary cervical cancer(CC) screening services may differentially impact women due to heterogeneity intheir screening history and test modality. Methods: We used three CC models toproject the short- and long-term health impacts assuming an underlying primaryscreening frequency (i.e., 1, 3, 5, or 10 yearly) under three alternativeCOVID-19-related screening disruption scenarios (i.e., 1-, 2- or 5-year delay)versus no delay, in the context of both cytology-based and HPV-based screening.Results: Models projected a relative increase in symptomatically-detected cancer cases during a 1-year delay period that was 38% higher (Policy1-Cervix), 80%higher (Harvard) and 170% higher (MISCAN-Cervix) for under-screened women whoselast cytology screen was 5 years prior to the disruption period compared withguidelines-compliant women (i.e., last screen three years prior to disruption).Over a woman's lifetime, temporary COVID-19-related delays had less impact onlifetime risk of developing CC than screening frequency and test modality;however, CC risks increased disproportionately the longer time had elapsed since a woman's last screen at the time of the disruption. Excess risks for a givendelay period were generally lower for HPV-based screeners than for cytology-basedscreeners. Conclusions: Our independent models predicted that the main drivers ofCC risk were screening frequency and screening modality, and the overall impactof disruptions from the pandemic on CC outcomes may be small. However, screening disruptions disproportionately affect under-screened women, underpinning theimportance of reaching such women as a critical area of focus, regardless oftemporary disruptions.

AB  - Unvaccinated COVID-19 patients display a large spectrum of symptoms, ranging fromasymptomatic to severe symptoms, the latter even causing death. Distinct Natural killer (NK) and CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells immune responses are generated inCOVID-19 patients. However, the phenotype and functional characteristics of NKcells and T-cells associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis versus protection remain to be elucidated. In this study, we compared the phenotype and function of NKcells SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells in unvaccinated symptomatic(SYMP) and unvaccinated asymptomatic (ASYMP) COVID-19 patients. The expression ofsenescent CD57 marker, CD45RA/CCR7differentiation status, exhaustion PD-1 marker,activation of HLA-DR, and CD38 markers were assessed on NK and T cells fromSARS-CoV-2 positive SYMP patients, ASYMP patients, and Healthy Donors (HD) using multicolor flow cytometry. We detected significant increases in the expressionlevels of both exhaustion and senescence markers on NK and T cells from SYMPpatients compared to ASYMP patients and HD controls. In SYMP COVID-19 patients,the T cell compartment displays several alterations involving naive, centralmemory, effector memory, and terminally differentiated T cells. The senescenceCD57 marker was highly expressed on CD8 (+) T EM cells and CD8 (+) T EMRA cells. Moreover, we detected significant increases in the levels of proinflammatoryTNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 cytokines from SYMP COVID-19patients, compared to ASYMP COVID-19 patients and HD controls. The findingssuggest exhaustion and senescence in both NK and T cell compartment is associatedwith severe disease in critically ill COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE: UnvaccinatedCOVID-19 patients display a large spectrum of symptoms, ranging from asymptomaticto severe symptoms, the latter even causing death. Distinct Natural killer (NK)and CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells immune responses are generated in COVID-19patients. In this study, we detected significant increases in the expressionlevels of both exhaustion and senescence markers on NK and T cells fromunvaccinated symptomatic (SYMP) compared to unvaccinated asymptomatic (ASYMP)COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we detected significant increases in the levels ofproinflammatory TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 cytokines from SYMPCOVID-19 patients, compared to ASYMP COVID-19 patients. The findings suggestexhaustion and senescence in both NK and T cell compartment is associated withsevere disease in critically ill COVID-19 patients. TWEET: Significant exhaustionand senescence in both NK and T cells were detected in unvaccinated symptomaticCOVID-19 patients, suggesting a weakness in both innate and adaptive immunesystems leads to severe disease in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Identification of the plasma proteomic changes of Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is essential to understanding the pathophysiology of the disease anddeveloping predictive models and novel therapeutics. We performed plasma deepproteomic profiling from 332 COVID-19 patients and 150 controls and pursuedreplication in an independent cohort (297 cases and 76 controls) to findpotential biomarkers and causal proteins for three COVID-19 outcomes (infection, ventilation, and death). We identified and replicated 1,449 proteins associatedwith any of the three outcomes (841 for infection, 833 for ventilation, and 253for death) that can be query on a web portal (https://covid.proteomics.wustl.edu/ ). Using those proteins and machine learning approached we created and validated specific prediction models for ventilation(AUC>0.91), death (AUC>0.95) and either outcome (AUC>0.80). These proteins werealso enriched in specific biological processes, including immune and cytokinesignaling (FDR </= 3.72x10 (-14) ), Alzheimer's disease (FDR </= 5.46x10 (-10) ) and coronary artery disease (FDR </= 4.64x10 (-2) ). Mendelian randomizationusing pQTL as instrumental variants nominated BCAT2 and GOLM1 as a causalproteins for COVID-19. Causal gene network analyses identified 141 highlyconnected key proteins, of which 35 have known drug targets with FDA-approvedcompounds. Our findings provide distinctive prognostic biomarkers for two severe COVID-19 outcomes (ventilation and death), reveal their relationship toAlzheimer's disease and coronary artery disease, and identify potentialtherapeutic targets for COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - Plus-strand RNA viruses are the largest group of viruses. Many are humanpathogens that inflict a socio-economic burden. Interestingly, plus-strand RNAviruses share remarkable similarities in their replication. A hallmark ofplus-strand RNA viruses is the remodeling of intracellular membranes to establishreplication organelles (so-called "replication factories"), which provide aprotected environment for the replicase complex, consisting of the viral genomeand proteins necessary for viral RNA synthesis. In the current study, weinvestigate pan-viral similarities and virus-specific differences in the lifecycle of this highly relevant group of viruses. We first measured the kinetics ofviral RNA, viral protein, and infectious virus particle production of hepatitis Cvirus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in theimmuno-compromised Huh7 cell line and thus without perturbations by an intrinsic immune response. Based on these measurements, we developed a detailedmathematical model of the replication of HCV, DENV, and CVB3 and show that onlysmall virus-specific changes in the model were necessary to describe the in vitrodynamics of the different viruses. Our model correctly predicted virus-specificmechanisms such as host cell translation shut off and different kinetics ofreplication organelles. Further, our model suggests that the ability to suppress or shut down host cell mRNA translation may be a key factor for in vitroreplication efficiency which may determine acute self-limited or chronicinfection. We further analyzed potential broad-spectrum antiviral treatmentoptions in silico and found that targeting viral RNA translation, especiallypolyprotein cleavage, and viral RNA synthesis may be the most promising drugtargets for all plus-strand RNA viruses. Moreover, we found that targeting onlythe formation of replicase complexes did not stop the viral replication in vitro early in infection, while inhibiting intracellular trafficking processes may evenlead to amplified viral growth. Author summary: Plus-strand RNA viruses comprise a large group of related and medically relevant viruses. The current globalpandemic of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-coronavirus-2 as well as the constantspread of diseases such as dengue and chikungunya fever show the necessity of acomprehensive and precise analysis of plus-strand RNA virus infections.Plus-strand RNA viruses share similarities in their life cycle. To understandtheir within-host replication strategies, we developed a mathematical model that studies pan-viral similarities and virus-specific differences of threeplus-strand RNA viruses, namely hepatitis C, dengue, and coxsackievirus. Byfitting our model to in vitro data, we found that only small virus-specificvariations in the model were required to describe the dynamics of all threeviruses. Furthermore, our model predicted that ribosomes involved in viral RNAtranslation seem to be a key player in plus-strand RNA replication efficiency,which may determine acute or chronic infection outcome. Furthermore, ourin-silico drug treatment analysis suggests that targeting viral proteasesinvolved in polyprotein cleavage, in combination with viral RNA replication, may represent promising drug targets with broad-spectrum antiviral activity.

AB  - Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we have witnessed a revolution invaccine development with the rapid emergence and deployment of both traditionaland novel vaccine platforms. The inactivated CoronaVac vaccine and the mRNA-basedPfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine are among the most widely distributed vaccines, bothdemonstrating high, albeit variable, vaccine effectiveness against severeCOVID-19 over time. Beyond the ability of the vaccines to generate neutralizingantibodies, antibodies can attenuate disease via their ability to recruit thecytotoxic and opsinophagocytic functions of the immune response. However, whetherFc-effector functions are induced differentially, wane with different kinetics,and are boostable, remains unknown. Here, using systems serology, we profiled theFc-effector profiles induced by the CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccines, over time.Despite the significantly higher antibody functional responses induced by theBNT162b2 vaccine, CoronaVac responses waned more slowly, albeit still found atlevels below those present in the systemic circulation of BNT162b2 immunizedindividuals. However, mRNA boosting of the CoronaVac vaccine responses resultedin the induction of significantly higher peak antibody functional responses with increased humoral breadth, including to Omicron. Collectively, the data presentedhere point to striking differences in vaccine platform-induced functional humoralimmune responses, that wane with different kinetics, and can be functionallyrescued and expanded with boosting.

AB  - Understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission within and among communities is criticalfor tailoring public health policies to local context. However, analysis ofcommunity transmission is challenging due to a lack of high-resolutionsurveillance and testing data. Here, using contact tracing records for 644,029cases and their contacts in New York City during the second pandemic wave, weprovide a detailed characterization of the operational performance of contacttracing and reconstruct exposure and transmission networks at individual and ZIP code scales. We find considerable heterogeneity in reported close contacts andsecondary infections and evidence of extensive transmission across ZIP codeareas. Our analysis reveals the spatial pattern of SARS-CoV-2 spread andcommunities that are tightly interconnected by exposure and transmission. We findthat higher vaccination coverage and reduced numbers of visitors topoints-of-interest are associated with fewer within- and cross-ZIP codetransmission events, highlighting potential measures for curtailing SARS-CoV-2spread in urban settings.

AB  - The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to be primed for viral entry by the host cell protease furin has become one of the most investigated of the numerous transmission andpathogenicity features of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 The variant B.1.1.529 (Omicron)emerged in late 2020 and has continued to evolve and is now present in severaldistinct sub-variants. Here, we analyzed the "furin cleavage site" of the spikeprotein of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron variant) in vitro , to assess the roleof two key mutations (spike, N679K and P681H) that are common across allsubvariants compared to the ancestral B.1 virus and other notable lineages. Weobserved significantly increased intrinsic cleavability with furin compared to anoriginal B lineage virus (Wuhan-Hu1), as well as to two variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha)and B.1.617 (Delta) that subsequently had wide circulation. Increasedfurin-mediated cleavage was attributed to the N679K mutation, which lies outside the conventional furin binding pocket. Our findings suggest that B.1.1.529(Omicron variant) has gained genetic features linked to intrinsic furincleavability, in line with its evolution within the population as the COVID-19pandemic has proceeded.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unsegmentedpositivesense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the beta-coronavirus .This virus was the cause of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2019(COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan, China at the early stage of the pandemic andrapidly spread around the world. Rapid transmission and reproduction ofSARS-CoV-2 threaten worldwide health with a high mortality rate from the virus.According to the significant role of non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) ininhibiting host mRNA translation, this study focuses on the link between aminoacid sequences of NSP1 and alterations of them spreading around the world. TheSARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein sequences were analyzed and FASTA files were processed byPython language programming libraries. Reference sequences compared with eachNSP1 sample to identify every mutation and categorize them were based oncontinents and frequencies. NSP1 mutations rate divided into continents weredifferent. Based on continental studies, E87D in global vision and also in Europenotably increased. The E87D mutation has significantly risen especially in thelast months of the study as the first frequent mutation observed. The remarkable mutations, H110Y and R24C, have the second and third frequencies, respectively.Based on this mutational information, despite NSP1 being a conserved sequenceoccurrence, these mutations change the rate of flexibility and stability of theNSP1 protein, which can eventually affect inhibiting the host translation.IMPORTANCE: In this study, we analyzed 6,510,947 sequences of non-structuralprotein 1 as a conserved region of SARS-CoV-2. According to the obtained results,93.4819% of samples had no mutant regions on their amino acid sequences. Heat mapdata of mutational samples demonstrated high percentages of mutations thatoccurred in the region of 72 to 126 amino acids indicating a hot spot region ofthe protein. Increased rates of E87D, H110Y, and R24C mutations in the timelineof our study were reported as significant compared to available mutant samples.Analyzing the details of replacing amino acids in the most frequent E87D mutationreveals the role of this alteration in increasing molecule flexibility anddestabilizing the structure of the protein.

AB  - Since the initial emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, several Omicronsublineages have emerged, leading to BA.5 as the current dominant sublineage.Here we report the neutralization of different Omicron sublineages by human sera collected from individuals who had distinct mRNA vaccination and/or BA.1infection. Four-dose-vaccine sera neutralize the original USA-WA1/2020, OmicronBA.1, BA.2, BA.212.1, BA.3, and BA.4/5 viruses with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 1554, 357, 236, 236, 165, and 95, respectively;2-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection sera exhibit GMTs of 2114, 1705, 730, 961,813, and 274, respectively; and 3-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection sera show GMTsof 2962, 2038, 983, 1190, 1019, and 297, respectively. Thus, 4-dose-vaccineelicits the lowest neutralization against BA.5;2-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection elicits significantly higher GMTs againstOmicron sublineages than 4-dose-vaccine; and 3-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infectionelicits slightly higher GMTs (statistically insignificant) than the2-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection. Our results support the inclusion of the BA.5spike for future vaccine booster doses.

LID - 10.1101/2022.07.26.501658 [doi]
AB  - Efficient spread of respiratory viruses requires the virus to maintaininfectivity in the environment. Environmental stability of viruses can beinfluenced by many factors, including temperature and humidity. Our studymeasured the impact of initial droplet volume (50, 5, and 1 microL) and relative humidity (RH: 40%, 65%, and 85%) on the stability of influenza A virus,bacteriophage, Phi6, a common surrogate for enveloped viruses, and SARS-CoV-2under a limited set of conditions. Our data suggest that the drying time requiredfor the droplets to reach quasi-equilibrium (i.e. a plateau in mass) varied with RH and initial droplet volume. The macroscale physical characteristics of thedroplets at quasi-equilibrium varied with RH but not with initial droplet volume.We observed more rapid virus decay when the droplets were still wet andundergoing evaporation, and slower decay after the droplets had dried. Initialdroplet volume had a major effect on virus viability over the first few hours;whereby the decay rate of influenza virus was faster in smaller droplets. Ingeneral, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 decayed similarly. Overall, this studysuggests that virus decay in media is closely correlated with the extent ofdroplet evaporation, which is controlled by RH. Taken together, these datasuggest that decay of different viruses is more similar at higher RH and insmaller droplets and is distinct at lower RH and in larger droplets. Importantly,accurate assessment of transmission risk requires use of physiologically relevantdroplet volumes and careful consideration of the use of surrogates. Funding:National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute ofNeurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health; Department ofHealth and Human Services; Flu Lab. Importance: During the COVID-19 pandemic,policy decisions were being driven by virus stability experiments involvingSARS-CoV-2 applied to surfaces in large droplets at various humidity conditions. The results of our study indicate that determination of half-lives for emergingpathogens in large droplets likely over-estimates transmission risk forcontaminated surfaces, as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our studyimplicates the need for the use of physiologically relevant droplet sizes withuse of relevant surrogates in addition to what is already known about theimportance of physiologically relevant media for risk assessment of futureemerging pathogens.

AB  - Psychological distress among healthcare professionals, although already a common condition, was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This effect has beengenerally self-reported or assessed through questionnaires. We aimed to identify potential abnormalities in the electrical activity of the brain of healthcareworkers, operating in different roles during the pandemic. Cortical activity,cognitive performances, sleep, and burnout were evaluated two times in 20COVID-19 frontline operators (FLCO, median age 29.5 years) and 20 operators whoworked in COVID-19-free units (CFO, median 32 years): immediately after theoutbreak of the pandemic (first session) and almost 6 months later (secondsession). FLCO showed higher theta relative power over the entire scalp (FLCO =19.4%; CFO = 13.9%; p = 0.04) and lower peak alpha frequency of electrodes F7(FLCO = 10.4 Hz; CFO = 10.87 Hz; p = 0.017) and F8 (FLCO = 10.47 Hz; CFO = 10.87 Hz; p = 0.017) in the first session. FLCO parietal interhemispheric coherence of theta (FLCO I = 0.607; FLCO II = 0.478; p = 0.025) and alpha (FLCO I = 0.578;FLCO II = 0.478; p = 0.007) rhythms decreased over time. FLCO also showed lowerscores in the global cognitive assessment test (FLCO = 22.72 points; CFO = 25.56;p = 0.006) during the first session. The quantitative evaluation of the cortical activity might therefore reveal early signs of changes secondary to stressexposure in healthcare professionals, suggesting the implementation of measuresto prevent serious social and professional consequences.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Iranians vaccinated with either AZD1222Vaxzevria, CovIran(R) vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated(lnCoV) or Sputnik V. Methods: We enrolled individuals 18 years or olderreceiving their first COVID-19 vaccine dose between April 2021 and January 2022in seven Iranian cities. Participants completed weekly follow-up surveys for 17weeks (25 weeks for AZD1222) to report their COVID-19 status and hospitalization.We used Cox regression models to assess risk factors for contracting COVID-19,hospitalization and death. Findings: Of 89 783 participants enrolled, incidencerates per 1 000 000 person-days were: 528.2 (95% confidence interval, CI:514.0-542.7) for contracting COVID-19; 55.8 (95% CI: 51.4-60.5) forhospitalization; and 4.1 (95% CI: 3.0-5.5) for death. Compared with SARS-CoV-2Vaccine (Vero Cell), hazard ratios (HR) for contracting COVID-19 were: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61-0.80) with AZD1222; 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62-0.86) with Sputnik V; and 0.73(95% CI: 0.63-0.86) with CovIran(R). For hospitalization and death, all vaccines provided similar protection 14 days after the second dose. History of COVID-19protected against contracting COVID-19 again (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69-0.84).Diabetes and respiratory, cardiac and renal disease were associated with higherrisks of contracting COVID-19 after vaccination. Conclusion: The rates ofcontracting COVID-19 after vaccination were relatively high. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine(Vero Cell) provided lower protection against COVID-19 than other vaccines.People with comorbidities had higher risks of contracting COVID-19 andhospitalization and should be prioritized for preventive interventions.

AB  - Problem: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed a major workforcechallenge to Brazil, which has a large land area and a shortage of health workersin regions distant from the big cities. Approach: The Brazilian health ministryimplemented a computerized solution to provide rapid support to states andmunicipalities to hire health professionals from large urban centres to work inunderserved areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. We designed an online system for health professionals to register their willingness to work on the COVID-19response; the system was launched to the public in April 2020. Local setting:Brazil is a large country with great heterogeneity in access to health careacross its different regions. Before the initiative was launched, 5 156 020health professionals were officially registered with professional councils.However, an estimated 3 200 000, more than 60% of them, were working in the tworegions with the highest standard of living. Relevant changes: Up to February2022, 1 007 138 health professionals had self-registered on the system, providinga sizeable database of professionals from a range of disciplines. Of these, 371275 professionals were willing to work on the COVID-19 response in remote areas. By 1 February 2022, 157 755 professionals have been trained and deployed to theseunderserved areas. Lessons learnt: Partnership of the government withprofessional councils and the use of official communication channels wereimportant strategies to improve registration and ensure the success of thescheme. We predict that the database will assist with future public healthcampaigns in Brazil.

TI  - The Impact of COVID-19 and Muscle Fatigue on Cardiorespiratory Fitness andRunning Kinetics in Female Recreational Runners.
PG  - 942589
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.942589 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is evidence that fully recovered COVID-19 patients usuallyresume physical exercise, but do not perform at the same intensity levelperformed prior to infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact ofCOVID-19 infection and recovery as well as muscle fatigue on cardiorespiratoryfitness and running biomechanics in female recreational runners. Methods:Twenty-eight females were divided into a group of hospitalized and recoveredCOVID-19 patients (COV, n = 14, at least 14 days following recovery) and a group of healthy age-matched controls (CTR, n = 14). Ground reaction forces fromstepping on a force plate while barefoot overground running at 3.3 m/s wasmeasured before and after a fatiguing protocol. The fatigue protocol consisted ofincrementally increasing running speed until reaching a score of 13 on the 6-20Borg scale, followed by steady-state running until exhaustion. The effects ofgroup and fatigue were assessed for steady-state running duration, steady-staterunning speed, ground contact time, vertical instantaneous loading rate and peak propulsion force. Results: COV runners completed only 56% of the running timeachieved by the CTR (p < 0.0001), and at a 26% slower steady-state running speed (p < 0.0001). There were fatigue-related reductions in loading rate (p = 0.004)without group differences. Increased ground contact time (p = 0.002) and reduced peak propulsion force (p = 0.005) were found for COV when compared to CTR.Conclusion: Our results suggest that female runners who recovered from COVID-19showed compromised running endurance and altered running kinetics in the form of longer stance periods and weaker propulsion forces. More research is needed inthis area using larger sample sizes to confirm our study findings.

TI  - A comparison of performance metrics for cloth masks as source control devices forsimulated cough and exhalation aerosols.
PG  - 1125-1142
LID - 10.1080/02786826.2021.1933377 [doi]
AB  - Universal mask wearing is recommended to help control the spread of COVID-19.Masks reduce the expulsion of aerosols of respiratory fluids into the environment(called source control) and offer some protection to the wearer. Masks are often characterized using filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and manikin orhuman fit factors, which are standard metrics used for personal protectivedevices. However, none of these metrics are direct measurements of howeffectively a mask blocks coughed and exhaled aerosols. We studied the sourcecontrol performance of 15 cloth masks (face masks, neck gaiters, and bandanas),two medical masks, and two N95 filtering facepiece respirators by measuring theirability to block aerosols </= 7 mum expelled during simulated coughing andexhalation (called source control collection efficiency). These measurements werecompared with filtration efficiencies, airflow resistances, and fit factorsmeasured on manikin headforms and humans. Collection efficiencies for the clothmasks ranged from 17% to 71% for coughing and 35% to 66% for exhalation.Filtration efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 1.4% to 98%, while thefit factors were 1.3 to 7.4 on headforms and 1.0 to 4.0 on human subjects. TheSpearman's rank correlation coefficients between the source control collectionefficiencies and the standard metrics ranged from 0.03 to 0.68 and weresignificant in all but two cases. However, none of the standard metrics werestrongly correlated with source control performance. A better understanding ofthe relationships between source control collection efficiency, filtrationefficiency, airflow resistance, and fit factor is needed.

LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab002 [doi]
AB  - Aims: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), myocardial injury is associatedwith systemic inflammation and higher mortality. Our aim was to perform a proofof concept trial with canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-1beta, inpatients with COVID-19, myocardial injury, and heightened inflammation. Methodsand results: This trial required hospitalization due to COVID-19, elevatedtroponin, and a C-reactive protein concentration more than 50 mg/L. The primaryendpoint was time to clinical improvement at Day 14, defined as either animprovement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from thehospital. The secondary endpoint was mortality at Day 28. Forty-five patientswere randomly assigned to canakinumab 600 mg (n = 15), canakinumab 300 mg (n =14), or placebo (n = 16). There was no difference in time to clinical improvementcompared to placebo [recovery rate ratio (RRR) for canakinumab 600 mg 1.15, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.46-2.91; RRR for canakinumab 300 mg 0.61, 95% CI0.23-1.64]. At Day 28, 3 (18.8%) of 15 patients had died in the placebo group,compared with 3 (21.4%) of 14 patients with 300 mg canakinumab, and 1 (6.7%) of15 patients with 600 mg canakinumab. There were no treatment-related deaths, and adverse events were similar between groups. Conclusion: There was no differencein time to clinical improvement at Day 14 in patients treated with canakinumab,and no safety concerns were identified. Future studies could focus on high dosecanakinumab in the treatment arm and assess efficacy outcomes at Day 28.

AB  - Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are a group that especially sufferedduring the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to facing the stress of dealing withpatients and social isolation, they had to worry about being infected themselves and transmitting the infection to their families. This study evaluated the fear, anxiety, and depression experienced by HCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. Subjects and Methods: The sample size was 541 HCWs. Data collection was done using anonline validated questionnaire through Google Docs, sent to HCWs by email andWhatsApp groups. We assessed depression and anxiety with the 4-item PatientHealth Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), while evaluating fear with the Fear of COVID-19Scale (FCV-19S). Results: A statistically significant difference was found in theperception of fear between married and unmarried people, and between those withcolleagues who had died from COVID-19 infection and those without. There was asignificant relation between HCWs' anxiety and a history of death from COVID-19infection, either of friends or of close relatives. The prevalence of depression was 18.48% in the tested sample of HCWs. Participants who had close relatives or friends infected with COVID-19 showed a significantly higher degree ofdepression. The age group <30 and those working 20 to 30 hours weekly showedhigher degrees of anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Sociodemographic variables such as age, marital status, and working area had a significant impact on themental and psychological health of HCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. HCWs who lostpatients due to COVID-19 had a significantly higher prevalence of fear,depression, and anxiety.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic hastransformed our appreciation of healthcare awareness worldwide. The amount ofrelated data accumulated during this time has surpassed any other outbreak of aviral pathogen. Healthcare awareness is related to one of the nine pillars of the"World health organization (WHO) operational planning guidelines to supportcountry preparedness and response". This review is structured around theawareness/knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP)-related publications in SaudiArabia up to date to understand the impact of COVID-19 on these domains. Theexcellent communication effort response from governments, international, andindividuals to keep the public informed about the outbreak is highlighted.Unraveling such impacts on the Saudi communities, including healthcare workers(HCWs)/professionals (HCPs), students, patients with different diseases, andnon-professional individuals, is essential in containing the outbreak andplanning preventive measures in case of future outbreaks.

TI  - Applied Geophysics for Managed Aquifer Recharge.
LID - 10.1111/gwat.13235 [doi]
AB  - Increasing water stress and decreasing supplies caused by growth and climatevariability have expanded demand for managed aquifer recharge (MAR) projects toprovide water supply resilience. Some of the most important factors indetermining the performance of a MAR project include site selection, subsurfacehydrogeologic characteristics and associated properties of the storage zone.Costs for invasive subsurface investigations to address these factors have slowlyincreased over the past two decades, with drilling costs increasing dramatically by as much as 30 percent or more since COVID 19 hit, a result of supply chainissues, steel prices, and manpower challenges. This paper provides a high-levelreview of major geophysical methods that have become more mainstream over thepast decade or two to supplement invasive subsurface investigations and are very cost effective when compared to drilling boreholes and installing wells, whichprovide only point data. The more commonly used surface geophysical methodsinclude ground-based and airborne time-domain electromagnetic methods (TEM),electrical resistivity, and seismic reflection. Airborne TEM methods (AEM)collect data very quickly, avoiding ground-based access constraints, andland-based methods are especially efficient using towed arrays. Electricalresistivity measurements provide resolution comparable to TEM but require moretime than towed methods. Seismic reflection surveys are more expensive than othermethods but typically have a much greater depth of penetration and can providehigh resolution information on aquifer geometry, geology, and faults. Boreholegeophysics is one of the more common methods used in MAR, providing near holeformation data and ground truths surface geophysics. This article is protected bycopyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predictors of Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 Undergoing Tracheotomy.
PG  - 34894221115752
LID - 10.1177/00034894221115752 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predictive of 30-day mortality followingtracheotomy in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective chart review ofpatients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheotomy at a tertiary medical centerbetween March 2020 and October 2021 was conducted. Univariate and multivariableanalyses of factors correlated with 30-day post-tracheotomy mortality wereperformed. The outcomes of tracheotomies performed in the operating room and atbedside were compared with t-tests and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Onehundred-twenty patients met inclusion criteria, with 48 female patients (40%).Mean age was 59.8 [12.6] years, and the 30-day mortality rate was 18.3%. Onunivariate analysis, age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.06; P = .015), FiO2 at the time of tracheotomy (OR = 1.06; P < .001), and bedside tracheotomy (OR = 3.21; P = .019) were associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality. After including control variables, increased FiO2 continued to predict increased odds of 30-day mortality(OR = 1.08; P = .02); specifically, patients with FiO2 > 65% were significantlymore likely to pass within 30 days than those with FiO2 </= 40% (OR = 28.24; P < .001). There was a significant difference in the 30-day mortality rate of bedsidetracheotomies (31%) and OR tracheotomies (12%; P = .02), but this association waseliminated on multivariable analysis (OR = 0.95; P = .96). CONCLUSION: Intubated patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheotomy with FiO2 > 65% have 25 timesgreater odds of 30-day mortality than those with FiO2 </= 40%. There were nodifferences in outcomes between bedside and OR tracheotomies.

AB  - Since the end of June 2022, there has been a dramatic increase in the number ofmonkeypox cases worldwide. Given the potential spread of this epidemic, WHO hasdeclared the monkeypox epidemic a global public health emergency. In the face of the changing epidemiology during this monkeypox outbreak, vaccines and preventivemeasures are being researched around the world in response to this emergingdisease. Recently, confirmed cases were reported in South Korea and Japan; asconnections between countries around the world resume, imported cases may beinevitable. China is also concerned and prepared for the danger approaching Asia.In response to this risk, China issued the "Monkeypox Diagnosis and TreatmentGuidelines" and the General Administration of Customs of China announced thattravelers from countries reporting monkeypox cases and with suspected symptomsshould be identified to customs upon entry. Chinese researchers have recentlygenerated two pseudovirus reference materials for the monkeypox viral wild-typeB6R gene and mutant F3L gene. Moreover, monkeypox as a communicable disease canbe added to the current COVID-19 tracking system for better surveillance andmanagement.

TI  - Test-to-Stay Implementation in Four Pre-K-12 School Districts.
LID - 10.1542/peds.2022-057362 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Globally, COVID-19 has affected how children learn. We evaluated theimpact of Test to Stay (TTS) on secondary and tertiary transmission of SARS-CoV-2and potential impact on in-person learning in four school districts in the UnitedStates from September 13-November 19, 2021. METHODS: Implementation of TTS variedacross school districts. Data on index cases, school-based close contacts, TTSparticipation, and testing results were obtained from four school districts indiverse geographic regions. Descriptive statistics, secondary and tertiary attackrisk, and a theoretical estimate of impact on in-person learning were calculated.RESULTS: Fifty-one schools in four school districts reported 374 COVID-19 indexcases and 2,520 school-based close contacts eligible for TTS. The proportionparticipating in TTS ranged from 22%-79%. By district, the secondary attack risk (SAR) and tertiary attack risk (TAR) among TTS participants ranged between2.2%-11.1% and 0%-17.6%, respectively. Nine clusters were identified amongsecondary cases and two among tertiary cases. The theoretical maximum number ofdays of in-person learning saved by using TTS was 976-4,650 days acrossjurisdictions. CONCLUSIONS: TTS preserves in-person learning days. Decisions toparticipate in TTS may have been influenced by ease of access to testing,communication between schools and families, testing logistics, and schoolresources. TAR determination became more complicated when numbers of closecontacts increased. Minimizing exposure through continued implementation oflayered prevention strategies is imperative. To ensure adequate resources forimplementation of TTS, community transmission levels should be considered.

TI  - Eosinophil-rich linear IgA bullous dermatosis induced by mRNA COVID-19 boostervaccine.
LID - 10.1111/cup.14305 [doi]
AB  - We present a case of eosinophil-rich linear IgA bullous disease (LABD) following administration of an mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine. A 66-year-old man presentedto the Emergency Department with a 3-week history of a pruritic blistering rashcharacterized by fluid-filled bullae and multiple annular and polycyclic plaques.He was initially diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid based on a biopsydemonstrating a subepidermal blister with numerous eosinophils. However, directimmunofluorescence studies showed linear IgA and IgM deposition along thebasement membrane zone with no immunoreactivity for C3 or IgG. Additionally,indirect immunofluorescence was positive for IgA basement membrane zone antibody.The patient was subsequently diagnosed with LABD and initiated on dapsone therapywith resolution of his lesions at three-month follow-up. This case illustratesthe growing number of autoimmune blistering adverse cutaneous reactions fromvaccination. Dermatopathologists should be aware that features of autoimmuneblistering diseases can overlap and may not be distinguishable based on thesehistopathological findings alone. Confirmation with direct immunofluorescenceand/or serological studies may be necessary for accurate diagnosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Perceived barriers to Palestinian pregnant women's acceptance of COVID-19vaccination using the Health Believe Model: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/03630242.2022.2108194 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to explore pregnant women's attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination anddeterminants of vaccine acceptance. We conducted a cross-sectional study amongpregnant women attending PHC clinics and hospitals in the West-bank of Palestine.We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire based on Health Belief Model.The study's primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. We used theChi-square test to compare those who accepted the vaccine versus those whorefused it and conducted binary logistic regression to explore independentdeterminants of vaccination acceptance. Among the 728 pregnant women who tookpart in the study, 20.7 percent showed positive attitudes (acceptance) towardCOVID-19 vaccination. Employment (aOR 4.0; 95 percentCI: 2.2-7.3), a history ofCOVID-19 (aOR 1.9; 95 percentCI: 1.2-3.1), and having a relative who died fromCOVID-19 (aOR 2.3; 95 percentCI: 1.2-4.7) increased the likelihood of vaccineacceptance, as did vaccine perceived effectiveness (aOR 1.9; 95 percentCI:1.2-3.2) and perceived protection from severe disease (aOR 2.0; 95 percentCI:1.2-3.5). On the other hand, perceived limited access (aOR 0.540; 95 percentCI:0.31-0.87) and perceived harm to the baby (aOR 0.346; 95 percentCI 0.22-0.54)remained the main barriers toward vaccine acceptance. In conclusion, pregnantwomen's acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is unsatisfactory. Concerns about its effect on unborn babies were major barriers to vaccination.

TI  - Sociodemographic predictors of depression in U.S. rural communities duringCOVID-19: Implications for improving mental healthcare access to increasedisaster preparedness.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.203 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to identify sociodemographicpredictors of depression for a rural population in the U.S. during the COVID-19pandemic, in order to enhance mental health disaster preparedness. METHODS: This study uses t-tests to differentiate between gender and ethnicity groups regardingdepression status; binary logistic regression to identify socio-demographiccharacteristics that predict depression status; and t-test to differentiatebetween average depression scores, measured by the PHQ-9, pre-COVID-19 pandemic(2019) and after it's start (2020). RESULTS: Results indicate men were lesslikely than women to report depression. Clients who identified as Latinx/Hispanicwere 2.8 times more likely than non-Hispanics to report depression and clientswho did not reside in public housing were 19.9% less likely to report depression.There was a statistically significant difference between mean PHQ-9 scores pre-and post-pandemic, with pre-pandemic scores lower on average, with a small effectsize. CONCLUSIONS: Building on findings from this study, we propose ways toincrease rural access to mental health services, through equitable access totelemedicine, to meet the needs of rural clients to increase disasterpreparedness.

PG  - 192
LID - 10.1186/s40359-022-00897-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a global need to explore thepotential and challenges of online education. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presenceof depression and anxiety in university students and their level of satisfaction with online learning during the period of social isolation caused by the COVID-19pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional design was used to evaluate 152 onlinelearning students from six different university courses: Medicine, Psychology,Law, Engineering, Physiotherapy, and Business. The evaluation of the participantswas carried out through an online survey in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Also, theHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess participants mentalhealth. RESULTS: Most of the participants reported emotional impact, followed by learning impact, financial impact, social impact, and technological impact, with a significant difference in the presence of depressive symptoms, but nosignificant difference in anxiety. The participants presented moderate anxietylevels, with no significant differences between genders, and mild levels ofdepressive symptoms with significant differences between genders. Also, youngerstudents were more anxious than older students. In addition, female students withless social contact presented more depressive symtoms. CONCLUSION: From aclinical perspective, the findings provide insights into mental health amonguniversity students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings may help in the development of effective screening strategies and in the formulation ofinterventions that improve the mental health of students.

TI  - Co-infection and ICU-acquired infection in COIVD-19 ICU patients: a secondaryanalysis of the UNITE-COVID data set.
PG  - 236
LID - 10.1186/s13054-022-04108-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic presented major challenges for critical carefacilities worldwide. Infections which develop alongside or subsequent to viralpneumonitis are a challenge under sporadic and pandemic conditions; however, datahave suggested that patterns of these differ between COVID-19 and other viralpneumonitides. This secondary analysis aimed to explore patterns of co-infection and intensive care unit-acquired infections (ICU-AI) and the relationship to use of corticosteroids in a large, international cohort of critically ill COVID-19patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter, international, observational study,including adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis admitted to ICUsat the peak of wave one of COVID-19 (February 15th to May 15th, 2020). Datacollected included investigator-assessed co-infection at ICU admission, infectionacquired in ICU, infection with multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) andantibiotic use. Frequencies were compared by Pearson's Chi-squared and continuousvariables by Mann-Whitney U test. Propensity score matching for variablesassociated with ICU-acquired infection was undertaken using R library MatchITusing the "full" matching method. RESULTS: Data were available from 4994patients. Bacterial co-infection at admission was detected in 716 patients (14%),whilst 85% of patients received antibiotics at that stage. ICU-AI developed in2715 (54%). The most common ICU-AI was bacterial pneumonia (44% of infections),whilst 9% of patients developed fungal pneumonia; 25% of infections involvedMDRO. Patients developing infections in ICU had greater antimicrobial exposurethan those without such infections. Incident density (ICU-AI per 1000 ICU days)was in considerable excess of reports from pre-pandemic surveillance.Corticosteroid use was heterogenous between ICUs. In univariate analysis, 58% of patients receiving corticosteroids and 43% of those not receiving steroidsdeveloped ICU-AI. Adjusting for potential confounders in the propensity-matchedcohort, 71% of patients receiving corticosteroids developed ICU-AI vs 52% ofthose not receiving corticosteroids. Duration of corticosteroid therapy was also associated with development of ICU-AI and infection with an MDRO. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatients with severe COVID-19 in the first wave, co-infection at admission to ICUwas relatively rare but antibiotic use was in substantial excess to thatindication. ICU-AI were common and were significantly associated with use ofcorticosteroids. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04836065(retrospectively registered April 8th 2021).

TI  - COVID-19 and hospital management costs: the Italian experience.
PG  - 991
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08365-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This article investigates the hospital costs related to themanagement of COVID-19 positive patients, requiring a hospitalization (from thepositivity confirmation to discharge, including rehabilitation activities).METHODS: A time-driven activity-based costing analysis, grounding onadministrative and accounting flows provided by the management control, wasimplemented to define costs related to the hospital management of COVID-19positive patients, according to real-word data, derived from six public ItalianHospitals, in 2020. RESULTS: Results reported that the higher the complexity ofcare, the higher the hospitalization cost per day (low-complexity = euro475.86;medium-complexity = euro700.20; high-complexity = euro1,401.65). Focusing on the entire clinical pathway, the overall resources absorption, with the inclusion of rehabilitation costs, ranged from 6,198.02euro to 32,141.20euro, dependent fromthe patient's clinical condition. CONCLUSIONS: Data could represent the baseline cost for COVID-19 hospital management, thus being useful for the furtherdevelopment of proper reimbursement tariffs devoted to hospitalized infectedpatients.

LID - 10.1186/s12909-022-03656-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic led to a lockdown of public life. Foruniversities, this meant suspensions or corresponding adaptations of practicalcourses. In Germany, Kiel Dental Clinic received special permission to startpractical courses under appropriate hygiene conditions. The study aimed atrecording the experiences and associated challenges of course implementationunder the special regulations from the perspective of students and teachers.METHODS: Qualitative guided interviews were conducted with students and teachers at Kiel in the summer semester 2020. Students (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th semesters)were recruited and lecturers responsible for conducting the practical courseswithin the dental clinic's four departments. Evaluation was carried out by means of qualitative content analysis, whereby deductive procedures were supplementedby inductive ones. RESULTS: Thirty-nine students and 19 lecturers took part. The flow of information at the start of the course was welcomed by students andteachers across the board. The lack of or limited adjustment to the scope tended to be assessed positively by students. The majority of both groups suspectedthere had been no reduction in learning, and learning had been improved due tothe smaller group sizes. Regarding the necessary conditions for conducting thecourse, positive and negative aspects became apparent. CONCLUSION: Students andteachers felt very relief to start the practical courses under special conditionsalthough the implementation was very challenging for both groups. The structural and content-related course adaptations required a high degree of flexibility onthe part of students and lecturers alike, but also meant that courses were ableto be conducted without serious deficits in learning gains.

TI  - Post-exposure prophylaxis with sotrovimab for Omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2variant during the aplastic phase of autologous stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/s13027-022-00454-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there is no information on the safety and efficacy of thenovel anti-sarbecoviruses monoclonal antibody sotrovimab administered, as apost-exposure prophylactic measure, during the aplastic phase of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). METHODS: We describe the outcomes of a MultipleMyeloma (MM) patient, who was threateningly exposed to the Omicron (B.1.1.529)SARS-CoV-2 variant, two days after having received a myeloablative regimen ofhigh-dose melphalan. The patient fulfilled all CDC criteria for prolonged closecontacts with an index patient who tested positive for a molecular nasopharyngealswab (Omicron; B.1.1.529) soon after admission to the ward. Given the high risks of morbidity and mortality in the case of COVID-19 developing during the aplasticphase of transplantation, we adopted a post-exposure prophylaxis interventionbased on intravenous (i.v.) sotrovimab. RESULTS: Sotrovimab (500 mg i.v.) wasadministered at day + 2 from stem cells reinfusion, i.e. 4 days aftermyeloablative chemotherapy, and at day + 5 from the last close contact with theOmicron-positive index case. The patient was fully protected from SARS-CoV-2infection throughout his clinical course and remained molecularly negative at theday + 30 from the transplant. We compared times to engraftment andtransplant-related toxicities of the sotrovimab-treated patient with the last 15 MM patients transplanted at our Centre, evidencing no unexpected safety signals, infusion-related reactions, or alarming effects on engraftment kinetics.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown here for the first time that administration ofsotrovimab during the pre-engraftment phase of ASCT is effective, safe, and notassociated with delays in hemopoietic recovery. As compared to MM patients whoreceived the same myeloablative conditioning regimen, the patient givensotrovimab during the aplastic phase did not show any significant differences in engraftment kinetics and toxicity outcomes. Post-exposure prophylaxis withsotrovimab may represent a valuable approach in the stem cell transplantationsetting for patients with high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 casesustained by highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants escaping the vaccine-derivedimmunity due to antigenic shifts in the spike proteins.

TI  - Challenges of Telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.1186/s12911-022-01952-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the decrease of in-person visitsto reduce the risk of virus transmission. Telemedicine is an efficientcommunication tool employed between healthcare providers and patients thatprevents the risk of exposure to infected persons. However, telemedicine use isnot infallible; its users reported multiple issues that complicated the expansionof this technology. So, this systematic review aimed to explore the barriers and challenges of telemedicine use during the pandemic and to propose solutions forimproving future use. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement.PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Embase, andScience Direct were used to look for articles addressing barriers and challenges,in addition to articles proposing solutions. Studies were screened by title andabstract, followed by a full-text review. Risk of bias assessment was done using Critical Appraisal Skills Program for qualitative studies, Newcastle-Ottawa Scalefor cross-sectional studies, and A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews. After the extraction of data, a narrative synthesis andanalysis of the outcomes were performed. RESULTS: Among 1194 papers identified,only 27 studies were included. Barriers and challenges were assembled under 7categories: technical aspects, privacy, data confidentiality and reimbursement,physical examination and diagnostics, special populations, training of healthcareproviders and patients, doctor-patient relationship, and acceptability. Poorinternet connection and lack of universal access to technology were among thetechnical barriers. Concerns about patient privacy and reimbursement hindered theuse of telemedicine too. Physical examination and certain procedures wereimpossible to perform via telemedicine. Training both healthcare providers andpatients was deficient. The doctor-patient relationship was troubled bytelemedicine, and both healthcare providers and patients were reluctant to usetelemedicine. CONCLUSION: Widespread use of telemedicine is still hampered byvarious barriers and challenges. Healthcare providers should work with variousstakeholders to implement the proposed solutions. More research and policychanges are essential to optimize telemedicine utilization.

TI  - Home office versus ergonomic workstation - is the ergonomic risk increased whenworking at the dining table? An inertial motion capture based pilot study.
PG  - 745
LID - 10.1186/s12891-022-05704-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to reduce the risk of infection with Sars-Cov-2, workpractices have been shifted to the home office in many industries. The firstsurveys concerning this shift indicate an increase in musculoskeletal complaints of many employees. The aim of this study was to compare the ergonomic risk in theupper extremities and trunk of working in a home office with that of working inan ergonomically optimized workplace. METHODS: For this purpose, 20 subjects(13w/7m) aged 18-31 years each performed a 20-minute workplace simulation (10 minwriting a text, 10 min editing a questionnaire) in the following set up: on adining table with dining chair and laptop (home office) and on an ergonomicallyadjusted workstation (ergonomically optimized workplace). The subjects wereinvestigated using a combined application of a motion capture kinematic analysis and the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) in order to identify differences inthe ergonomic risk. RESULTS: Significantly reduced risk values for both shoulders(left: p < 0.001; right: p = 0.02) were found for the ergonomically optimizedworkstations. In contrast, the left wrist (p = 0.025) showed a significantlyreduced ergonomic risk value for the home office workstation. CONCLUSION: Thisstudy is the first study to compare the ergonomic risk between an ergonomicallyoptimized workplace and a home office workstation. The results indicate minordifferences in the upper extremities in favor of the ergonomically optimizedworkstation. Since work-related musculoskeletal complaints of the upperextremities are common among office workers, the use of an ergonomicallyoptimized workstation for home use is recommended based on the results.

TI  - Virtual screening of Indonesian herbal compounds as COVID-19 supportive therapy: machine learning and pharmacophore modeling approaches.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.1186/s12906-022-03686-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of COVID-19 cases continues to grow in Indonesia. Thisphenomenon motivates researchers to find alternative drugs that function forprevention or treatment. Due to the rich biodiversity of Indonesian medicinalplants, one alternative is to examine the potential of herbal medicines tosupport COVID therapy. This study aims to identify potential compound candidates in Indonesian herbal using a machine learning and pharmacophore modelingapproaches. METHODS: We used three classification methods that had differentdecision-making processes: support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron(MLP), and random forest (RF). For the pharmacophore modeling approach, weperformed a structure-based analysis on the 3D structure of the main proteaseSARS-CoV-2 (3CLPro) and repurposed SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 drugs identifiedfrom the literature as datasets in the ligand-based method. Lastly, we usedmolecular docking to analyze the interactions between the 3CLpro and 14 hitcompounds from the Indonesian Herbal Database (HerbalDB), with lopinavir as apositive control. RESULTS: From the molecular docking analysis, we found sixpotential compounds that may act as the main proteases of the SARS-CoV-2inhibitor: hesperidin, kaempferol-3,4'-di-O-methyl ether (Ermanin);myricetin-3-glucoside, peonidin 3-(4'-arabinosylglucoside); quercetin3-(2G-rhamnosylrutinoside); and rhamnetin 3-mannosyl-(1-2)-alloside. CONCLUSIONS:Our layered virtual screening with machine learning and pharmacophore modelingapproaches provided a more objective and optimal virtual screening and avoidedsubjective decision making of the results. Herbal compounds from the screening,i.e. hesperidin, kaempferol-3,4'-di-O-methyl ether (Ermanin);myricetin-3-glucoside, peonidin 3-(4'-arabinosylglucoside); quercetin3-(2G-rhamnosylrutinoside); and rhamnetin 3-mannosyl-(1-2)-alloside are potentialantiviral candidates for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regardless of improvements in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of comprehensive insight into SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is still asophisticated challenge. In order to deal with this challenge, we utilizedadvanced bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms to reveal morecharacteristics of SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis and introduce novel hostresponse-based diagnostic biomarker panels. METHODS: In the present study, eight published RNA-Seq datasets related to whole-blood (WB) and nasopharyngeal (NP)swab samples of patients with COVID-19, other viral and non-viral acuterespiratory illnesses (ARIs), and healthy controls (HCs) were integrated. Todefine COVID-19 meta-signatures, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyseswere applied to compare COVID-19 with other similar diseases. Additionally,CIBERSORTx was executed in WB samples to detect the immune cell landscape.Furthermore, the optimum WB- and NP-based diagnostic biomarkers were identifiedvia all the combinations of 3 to 9 selected features and the 2-phases machinelearning (ML) method which implemented k-fold cross validation and independenttest set validation. RESULTS: The host gene meta-signatures obtained forSARS-COV-2 infection were different in the WB and NP samples. The gene ontologyand enrichment results of the WB dataset represented the enhancement ininflammatory host response, cell cycle, and interferon signature in COVID-19patients. Furthermore, NP samples of COVID-19 in comparison with HC and non-viralARIs showed the significant upregulation of genes associated with cytokineproduction and defense response to the virus. In contrast, these pathways inCOVID-19 compared to other viral ARIs were strikingly attenuated. Notably, immunecell proportions of WB samples altered in COVID-19 versus HC. Moreover, theoptimum WB- and NP-based diagnostic panels after two phases of ML-basedvalidation included 6 and 8 markers with an accuracy of 97% and 88%,respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the distinct gene expression profiles of WBand NP, our results indicated that SARS-COV-2 function is body-site-specific,although according to the common signature in WB and NP COVID-19 samples versuscontrols, this virus also induces a global and systematic host response to someextent. We also introduced and validated WB- and NP-based diagnostic biomarkersusing ML methods which can be applied as a complementary tool to diagnose theCOVID-19 infection from non-COVID cases.

TI  - Astrocytes and the Psychiatric Sequelae of COVID-19: What We Learned from thePandemic.
LID - 10.1007/s11064-022-03709-7 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19, initially regarded as specific lung disease, exhibits an extremelybroad spectrum of symptoms. Extrapulmonary manifestations of the disease alsoinclude important neuropsychiatric symptoms with atypical characteristics. Arethese disturbances linked to stress accompanying every systemic infection, or aredue to specific neurobiological changes associated with COVID-19? Evidenceaccumulated so far indicates that the pathophysiology of COVID-19 ischaracterized by systemic inflammation, hypoxia resulting from respiratoryfailure, and neuroinflammation (either due to viral neurotropism or in responseto cytokine storm), all affecting the brain. It is reasonable to hypothesize thatall these events may initiate or worsen psychiatric and cognitive disorders.Damage to the brain triggers a specific type of reactive response mounted byneuroglia cells, in particular by astrocytes which are the homeostatic cell parexcellence. Astrocytes undergo complex morphological, biochemical, and functionalremodeling aimed at mobilizing the regenerative potential of the central nervous system. If the brain is not directly damaged, resolution of systemic pathologyusually results in restoration of the physiological homeostatic status ofneuroglial cells. The completeness and dynamics of this process in pathologicalconditions remain largely unknown. In a subset of patients, glial cells couldfail to recover after infection thus promoting the onset and progression ofCOVID-19-related neuropsychiatric diseases. There is evidence from post-mortemexaminations of the brains of COVID-19 patients of alterations in both astrocytesand microglia. In conclusion, COVID-19 activates a huge reactive response ofglial cells, that physiologically act as the main controller of the inflammatory,protective and regenerative events. However, in some patients the restoration of glial physiological state does not occur, thus compromising glial function andultimately resulting in homeostatic failure underlying a set of specificneuropsychiatric symptoms related to COVID-19.

TI  - Ursolic acid and SARS-CoV-2 infection: a new horizon and perspective.
LID - 10.1007/s10787-022-01038-3 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) has beenidentified as the source of a world coronavirus pandemic in 2019. Covid-19 isconsidered a main respiratory disease-causing viral pneumonia and, in severecases, leads to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS). Although, extrapulmonary manifestations of Covid-19 like neurological,cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal have been confirmed. Exaggerated immuneresponse and release of a high amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines may progress,causing a cytokine storm. Consequently, direct and indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2infection can evolve into systemic complications due to the progression of hyper inflammation, oxidative stress and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Therefore, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents could be efficient in alleviating these disorders. Ursolic acid has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, andantiviral effects; it reduces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improvesanti-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibits the production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS). In virtue of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects,ursolic acid may minimize SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced complications. Also, byregulating RAS and inflammatory signaling pathways, ursolic acid mighteffectively reduce the development of ALI in ARDS in Covid-19. In this state,this perspective discusses how ursolic acid can mitigate hyper inflammation andoxidative stress in Covid-19.

TI  - Factors associated with colorectal cancer screening adherence and the impact ofCOVID-19 on screening patterns in Connecticut, USA.
LID - 10.1007/s11739-022-03053-2 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide.Many communities remain under the 80% CRC screening goal. We aimed to identifyfactors associated with non-adherence to CRC screening and to describe the effectof the COVID-19 pandemic in CRC screening patterns. A retrospective review ofpatients aged 50-75 years seen at the Griffin Faculty Physicians primary careoffices between January 2019 and December 2020 was performed. Logistic regressionmodels were used to identify factors associated with CRC screening non-adherence.Of 12,189 patients, 66.2% had an updated CRC screen. On univariable logisticregression, factors associated with CRC screening non-adherence included age </= 55 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.267, p < 0.001], White/Caucasian race (OR 0.858, p = 0.030), Medicaid insurance (OR 2.097, p < 0.001), morbid obesity (OR 1.436, p <0.001), current cigarette smoking (OR 1.849, p < 0.001), and elevated HbA1c (OR1.178, p = 0.004). Age, Medicaid insurance, morbid obesity, current smoking, and HbA1c >/= 6.5% remained significant in the final multivariable model. Compared to2019, there was an 18.2% decrease in the total number of CRC screening tests in2020. The proportion of colonoscopy procedures was lower in 2020 compared to the proportion of colonoscopy procedures conducted in 2019 (65.9% vs 81.7%, p <0.001), with a concurrent increase in stool-based tests. CRC screening rates inour population are comparable to national statistics but below the 80% goal.COVID-19 affected CRC screening. Our results underscore the need to identifypatient groups most vulnerable to missing CRC screening and highlight theimportance of stool-based testing to bridge screening gaps.

TI  - Telemedicine for Retinal Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey of thePatient Perspective.
LID - 10.1007/s40123-022-00555-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has emerged as a safeand cost-effective alternative to traditional ophthalmology clinic visits. Thisstudy evaluated patient attitudes towards telemedicine at a full-service,retina-only practice to identify areas for growth in implementation. METHODS: Asurvey was distributed to established patients at University Retina and MaculaAssociates following the completion of a telemedicine encounter in July 2021. On a 5-point Likert scale, patients compared telemedicine to in-person visits forsix domains: ability to ease COVID-related anxiety, efficiency, patienteducation, quality of care, fulfillment of personal needs, and convenience.Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact test were used to assess correlations betweendemographic factors and patient attitudes or preference towards telemedicine.RESULTS: Among 103 respondents, two-thirds (68.7%) preferred in-person comparedto telemedicine encounters. Overall, patients had a neutral attitude towardstelemedicine [mean Likert rating (SD) = 3.11/5 +/- 0.82]. Questions assessing"patient education" and "telemedicine efficiency" received the greatestproportion of positive and negative responses, respectively. Positive attitudeswere more frequent among patients with prior telemedicine experience (87.5%)compared to never-users (71.8%; p = 0.046). Patients >/= 75 years old tended tonegatively assess telemedicine regarding reduction of COVID-19-related anxiety,efficiency, patient education, and physician facetime (p < 0.05 for all). Apositive but non-significant trend was observed between higher education leveland positive attitude towards telemedicine (p = 0.18). Telehealth never-usersmore often negatively rated receiving adequate facetime with the physicianvirtually (54.7%) compared to prior users (25.6%; p = 0.004). Younger age, prior history of telemedicine use, and higher education level were associated withincreased preference for telemedicine (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Ourfindings revealed hesitance remains among patients towards adoption oftelemedicine. Targeting age-, experience-, and education-related barriers will beinvaluable for increasing acceptance of this healthcare delivery model.

TI  - The Structural Analysis: Incorporating Structurally Competent Clinical Reasoning into Case-Based Presentations.
LID - 10.1007/s11606-022-07751-7 [doi]
AB  - Structural and social determinants of health account for the health disparitieswe see along social hierarchies, and their impact has been made more evident bythe recent COVID-19 pandemic. There have been increasing calls to incorporatestructural competency into medical education. The structural and social context, however, has yet to be fully integrated into everyday clinical practice andlittle has been published on how to concretely imbed structural competency intoclinical reasoning. The authors provide a framework for structural analysis,which incorporates four key steps: (1) developing a prioritized clinical problem list, (2) identifying social and structural root causes for clinical problems,(3) constructing and documenting a prioritized structural problem list, and (4)brainstorming solutions to address structural barriers and social needs. Theyshow how structural analysis can be used to operationalize structural reasoninginto everyday inpatient and outpatient clinical assessments.

TI  - COVID-19 associated multisystemic mucormycosis from India: a multicentricretrospective study on clinical profile, predisposing factors, cumulativemortality and factors affecting outcome.
LID - 10.1007/s15010-022-01891-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The clinical course of COVID-19 has been complicated by secondaryinfections, including bacterial and fungal infections. The rapid rise in theincidence of invasive mucormycosis in these patients is very much concerning.COVID-19-associated mucormycosis was detected in huge numbers during the secondwave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, with several predisposing factorsindicated in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology,predisposing factor, cumulative mortality and factors affecting outcomes amongthe coronavirus disease COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). METHODS: Amulticenter retrospective study across three tertiary health care centers inSouthern part of India was conducted during April-June 2021. RESULTS: Among the217 cases of CAM, mucormycosis affecting the nasal sinuses was the commonest,affecting 95 (44%) of the patients, orbital extension seen in 84 (38%), pulmonary(n = 25, 12%), gastrointestinal (n = 6, 3%), isolated cerebral (n = 2) anddisseminated mucormycosis (n = 2). Diabetes mellitus, high-dose systemic steroidswere the most common underlying disease among CAM patients. Themucormycosis-associated case-fatality at 6 weeks was 14%, cerebral or GI ordisseminated mucormycosis had 9 times higher risk of death compared to otherlocations. Extensive surgical debridement along with sequential antifungal drugtreatment improved the survival in mucormycosis patients. CONCLUSION: Judiciousand appropriate management of the predisposing factor and factors affectingmortality associated with CAM with multi-disciplinary approach and timelysurgical and medical management can be much helpful in achieving a successfuloutcome.

TI  - Evaluation of urban green space per capita with new remote sensing and geographicinformation system techniques and the importance of urban green space during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 633
LID - 10.1007/s10661-022-10298-z [doi]
AB  - A recently conducted study by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionencouraged access to urban green space for the public over the prevalence ofCOVID-19 in that exposure to urban green space can positively affect the physicaland mental health, including the reduction rate of heart disease, obesity,stress, stroke, and depression. COVID-19 has foregrounded the inadequacy of greenspace in populated cities. It has also highlighted the extant inequities so as tounequal access to urban green space both quantitatively and qualitatively. Inthis regard, it seems that one of the problems related to Malatya is theuncoordinated distribution of green space in different parts of the city.Therefore, knowing the quantity and quality of these spaces in each region canplay an effective role in urban planning. The aim of the present study has beento evaluate urban green space per capita and to investigate its distributionbased on the population of the districts of Battalgazi county in Malatya citythrough developing an integrated methodology (remote sensing and geographicinformation system). Accordingly, in Google Earth Engine by images of Sentinel-1 and PlanetScope satellites, it was calculated different indexes (NDVI, EVI, PSSR,GNDVI, and NDWI). The data set was prepared and then by combining different data,classification was performed according to support vector machine algorithm. From the landscaping maps obtained, the map was selected with the highest accuracy(overall accuracy: 94.43; and kappa coefficient: 90.5). Finally, by the obtained last map, the distribution of urban green space per capita and their functions inBattalgazi county and its districts were evaluated. The results of the studyshowed that the existing urban green spaces in the Battalgazi/Malatya were notdistributed evenly on the basis of the districts. The per capita of urban greenspace is twenty-four regions which is more than 9m(2) and in twenty-three ones isless than 9m(2). The recommendation of this study was that Turkiye city planners and landscape designers should replan and redesign the quality and equaldistribution of urban green spaces, especially during and following COVID-19pandemic. Additionally, drawing on the Google Earth Engine cloud system, whichhas revolutionized GIS and remote sensing, is recommended to be used in land use land cover modeling. It is straightforward to access information and analyze themquickly in Google Earth Engine. The published codes in this study makes itpossible to conduct further relevant studies.

PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s40352-022-00184-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with substance use disorders (SUD), particularly opioiduse disorder (OUD), who are criminal justice-involved are a particularlyvulnerable population that has been adversely affected by COVID-19 due to impactsof the pandemic on both the criminal justice and treatment systems. Themanuscript presents qualitative data and findings exploring issues related toSUD/OUD treatment among individuals involved in the justice system and theimpacts of COVID-19 on these service systems. Qualitative data were collectedseparately by teams from three different research hubs/sites in Illinois,Indiana, and Kentucky; at each hub, data were collected from justice systempersonnel (n = 17) and community-level SUD/OUD providers (n = 21). Codes from twohubs were reviewed and merged to develop the cross-hub coding list. The combined codes were used deductively to analyze the third hub's data, and higher-levelthemes were then developed across all the hubs' data. RESULTS: Themes reflectedthe justice and treatment systems' responses to COVID-19, the intersection ofsystems and COVID-19's impact on providing OUD treatment for such individuals,and the use of telehealth and telejustice. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight thatdespite rapid adaptations made by systems during the pandemic, additional work isneeded to better support individuals with OUD who are involved in the justicesystem. Such work can inform longer-term public health crisis planning to improvecommunity OUD treatment access and linkage for those who are criminaljustice-involved.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine for detection of surgical site infection: asystematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1038/s41746-022-00655-0 [doi]
AB  - The Sars-CoV-2 pandemic catalysed integration of telemedicine worldwide. Thissystematic review assesses it's accuracy for diagnosis of Surgical Site Infection(SSI). Databases were searched for telemedicine and wound infection studies. All types of studies were included, only paired designs were taken to meta-analysis. QUADAS-2 assessed methodological quality. 1400 titles and abstracts werescreened, 61 full text reports were assessed for eligibility and 17 studies were included in meta-analysis, mean age was 47.1 +/- 13.3 years. Summary sensitivity and specificity was 87.8% (95% CI, 68.4-96.1) and 96.8% (95% CI 93.5-98.4)respectively. The overall SSI rate was 5.6%. Photograph methods had lowersensitivity and specificity at 63.9% (95% CI 30.4-87.8) and 92.6% (95% CI,89.9-94.5). Telemedicine is highly specific for SSI diagnosis is highly specific,giving rise to great potential for utilisation excluding SSI. Further work isneeded to investigate feasibility telemedicine in the elderly population group.

TI  - Assessing the impact of long-term exposure to nine outdoor air pollutants onCOVID-19 spatial spread and related mortality in 107 Italian provinces.
PG  - 13317
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17215-x [doi]
AB  - This paper investigates the air quality in 107 Italian provinces in the period2014-2019 and the association between exposure to nine outdoor air pollutants andthe COVID-19 spread and related mortality in the same areas. The methods usedwere negative binomial (NB) regression, ordinary least squares (OLS) model, andspatial autoregressive (SAR) model. The results showed that (i) common airpollutants-nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)-were highly and positively correlated with large firms, energy and gasconsumption, public transports, and livestock sector; (ii) long-term exposure to NO2, PM2.5, PM10, benzene, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and cadmium (Cd) was positively and significantly correlated with the spread of COVID-19; and (iii) long-termexposure to NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and arsenic (As) was positively andsignificantly correlated with COVID-19 related mortality. Specifically,particulate matter and Cd showed the most adverse effect on COVID-19 prevalence; while particulate matter and As showed the largest dangerous impact on excessmortality rate. The results were confirmed even after controlling for eighteencovariates and spatial effects. This outcome seems of interest because benzene,BaP, and heavy metals (As and Cd) have not been considered at all in recentliterature. It also suggests the need for a national strategy to drive down airpollutant concentrations to cope better with potential future pandemics.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of heparin full-dose anticoagulation in hospitalizednon-critically ill COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis of multicenter randomizedcontrolled trials.
LID - 10.1007/s11239-022-02681-x [doi]
AB  - Arterial and venous thrombotic events in COVID-19 cause significant morbidity andmortality among patients. Although international guidelines agree on the need foranticoagulation, it is unclear whether full-dose heparin anticoagulation confers additional benefits over prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. This systematicreview and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of heparin full-dose anticoagulation in hospitalized non-critically ill COVID-19 patients.We searched Pubmed/Medline, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov, medRxiv.org and Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials dated up to April 2022. Randomized controlledtrials (RCTs) comparing full-dose heparin anticoagulation to prophylactic-doseanticoagulation or standard treatment in hospitalized non-critically ill COVID-19patients were included in our pooled analysis. The primary endpoint was the rate of major thrombotic events and the co-primary endpoint was the rate of majorbleeding events. We identified 4 studies, all of them multicenter, randomizing2926 patients. Major thrombotic events were 23/1524 (1.5%) in full-dose heparinanticoagulation versus 57/1402 (4.0%) in prophylactic-dose [relative risk (RR)0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.62; p<0.01; I(2) = 0%]. Clinicalrelevant bleeding events occurred in 1.7% (26/1524) among patients treated withheparin full anticoagulation dose compared to 1.1% (15/1403) in prophylactic-dosegroup (RR 1.60; 95% CI 0.85-3.03; p = 0.15; I(2) = 20%). Mortality was 6.6%(101/1524) versus 8.6% (121/1402) (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.33-1.19; p = 0.15). In this meta-analysis of high quality multicenter randomized trials, full-doseanticoagulation with heparin was associated with lower rate of major thromboticevents without differences in bleeding risk and mortality in hospitalized noncritically ill COVID-19 patients.Study registration PROSPERO, review no.CRD42022301874.

AB  - Researchers are focused on discovering compounds that can interfere with theCOVID-19 life cycle. One of the important non-structural proteins isendoribonuclease since it is responsible for processing viral RNA to evadedetection of the host defense system. This work investigates a hierarchicalstructure-based virtual screening approach targeting NSP15. Different filteringapproaches to predict the interactions of the compounds have been included inthis study. Using a deep learning technique, we screened 823,821 compounds fromfive different databases (ZINC15, NCI, Drug Bank, Maybridge, and NCI Diversityset III). Subsequently, two docking protocols (extra precision and induced fit)were used to assess the binding affinity of the compounds, followed by molecular dynamic simulation supported by the MM-GBSA free binding energy. Interestingly,one compound (ZINC000104379474) from the ZINC15 database has been found to have agood binding affinity of - 7.68 kcal/Mol. The VERO-E6 cell line was used toinvestigate its therapeutic effect in vitro. Half-maximal cytotoxic concentrationand Inhibitory concentration 50 were determined to be 0.9 mg/ml and 0.01 mg/ml,respectively; therefore, the selectivity index is 90. In conclusion,ZINC000104379474 was shown to be a good hit for targeting the virus that needsfurther investigations in vivo to be a drug candidate.

TI  - Ability of IMPROVE and IMPROVE-DD scores to predict outcomes in patients withsevere COVID-19: a prospective observational study.
PG  - 13323

AB  - In this study we aimed to evaluate the ability of IMPROVE and IMPROVE-DD scoresin predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with severe COVID-19. Thisprospective observational study included adult patients with severe COVID-19within 12 h from admission. We recorded patients' demographic and laboratorydata, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), SpO2 at room air, acute physiology andchronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), IMPROVE score and IMPROVE-DD score.In-hospital mortality and incidence of clinical worsening (the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy) were recorded.Our outcomes included the ability of the IMPROVE and IMPROVE-DD to predictin-hospital mortality and clinical worsening using the area under receiveroperating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Multivariate analysis was used to detect independent risk factors for the study outcomes. Eighty-nine patients wereavailable for the final analysis. The IMPROVE and IMPROVE-DD score showed thehighest ability for predicting in-hospital mortality (AUC [95% confidenceintervals {CI}] 0.96 [0.90-0.99] and 0.96 [0.90-0.99], respectively) incomparison to other risk stratification tools (APACHE II, CCI, SpO2). The AUC(95% CI) for IMPROVE and IMPROVE-DD to predict clinical worsening were 0.80(0.70-0.88) and 0.79 (0.69-0.87), respectively. Using multivariate analysis,IMPROVE-DD and SpO2 were the only predictors for in-hospital mortality andclinical worsening. In patients with severe COVID-19, high IMPROVE and IMOROVE-DDscores showed excellent ability to predict in-hospital mortality and clinicalworsening. Independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality and clinicalworsening were IMPROVE-DD and SpO2.

TI  - An intranasal ASO therapeutic targeting SARS-CoV-2.
PG  - 4503
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32216-0 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is exacting an increasing toll worldwide, with newSARS-CoV-2 variants emerging that exhibit higher infectivity rates and that maypartially evade vaccine and antibody immunity. Rapid deployment of non-invasivetherapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variantscould complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on theCOVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting theSARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs).We identify an LNA ASO binding to the 5' leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 thatdisrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy inpreventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration ofthis LNA ASO in the COVID-19 mouse model potently suppresses viral replication(>80-fold) in the lungs of infected mice. We find that the LNA ASO is efficaciousin countering all SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" tested both in vitro and invivo. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promisingtherapeutic approach to reduce or prevent transmission and decrease severity ofCOVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can beflexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences and could be stockpiledfor future coronavirus pandemics.

AB  - Rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has led to record-breakingcase incidence rates around the world. Since May 2020, the REal-time Assessmentof Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study tracked the spread of SARS-CoV-2infection in England through RT-PCR of self-administered throat and nose swabsfrom randomly-selected participants aged 5 years and over. In January 2022, wefound an overall weighted prevalence of 4.41% (n = 102,174), three-fold higherthan in November to December 2021; we sequenced 2,374 (99.2%) Omicron infections (19 BA.2), and only 19 (0.79%) Delta, with a growth rate advantage for BA.2compared to BA.1 or BA.1.1. Prevalence was decreasing overall (reproductionnumber R = 0.95, 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.93, 0.97), but increasing inchildren aged 5 to 17 years (R = 1.13, 95% CrI, 1.09, 1.18). In England duringJanuary 2022, we observed unprecedented levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection,especially among children, driven by almost complete replacement of Delta byOmicron.

AB  - Defective interfering genes (DIGs) are short viral genomes and interfere withwild-type viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the new designedSARS-CoV-2 DIG (CD3600) can significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2including Alpha, Delta, Kappa and Omicron variants in human HK-2 cells andinfluenza DIG (PAD4) can significantly inhibit influenza virus replication inhuman A549 cells. One dose of influenza DIGs prophylactically protects 90% micefrom lethal challenge of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and CD3600 inhibits SARS-CoV-2replication in hamster lungs when DIGs are administrated to lungs one day before viral challenge. To further investigate the gene delivery vector in therespiratory tract, a peptidic TAT2-P1&LAH4, which can package genes to form smallspherical nanoparticles with high endosomal escape ability, is demonstrated todramatically increase gene expression in the lung airway. TAT2-P1&LAH4, with the dual-functional TAT2-P1 (gene-delivery and antiviral), can deliver CD3600 tosignificantly inhibit the replication of Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in hamster lungs. This peptide-based nanoparticle system can effectively transfect genes in lungs and deliver DIGs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants and influenza virus invivo, which provides the new insight into the drug delivery system for genetherapy against respiratory viruses.

TI  - Optimisation of COVID-19 diagnostic pathways in acute hospital admissions toprevent nosocomial transmission.
LID - 10.1111/crj.13530 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the management of acute hospital admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, safe patient cohorting depends on robust admission diagnosticstrategies. It is essential that screening strategies are sensitive and rapid, toprevent nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 and maintain patient flow. METHODS:We retrospectively identified all COVID-19 positive and suspected cases at ourinstitution screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between 4 April and 28 June 2020. Using RT-PCR positivity within 7 days as ourreference standard, we assessed sensitivity and net-benefit of three admissionscreening strategies: single admission RT-PCR, composite admission RT-PCR and CXRand repeat RT-PCR with 48 h. RESULTS: RT-PCR single-test sensitivity was 91.5%(87.8%-94.4%) versus 97.7% (95.4%-99.1%) (p = 0.025) for RT-PCR/CXR compositetesting and 95.1% (92.1%-97.2%) (p = 0.03) for repeated RT-PCR. Net-benefit was0.83 for single RT-PCR versus 0.89 for RT-PCR/CXR and 0.87 for repeated RT-PCR at0.02% threshold probability. CONCLUSION: The RT-PCR/CXR composite testingstrategy was highly sensitive when screening patients at the point of hospitaladmission. Real-world sensitivity of this approach was comparable to repeatRT-PCR testing within 48 h; however, faster facilitating improved patient flow.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Rapid identification and isolation of patients withCOVID-19 are critical strategies to contain COVID-19. The saliva antigen test hasthe advantages of noninvasiveness and decreased transmission risk to health-care professionals. This meta-analysis investigated the diagnostic accuracy of thesaliva antigen test for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Biomed Central. Studies evaluating thediagnostic accuracy of saliva antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Thedata of the included studies were used to construct a 2 x 2 table on a perpatient basis. The overall sensitivity and specificity of saliva antigen testswere determined using a bivariate random-effects model. RESULTS: Nine studiesenrolling 9842 patients were included. The meta-analysis generated a pooledsensitivity of 65.3% and a pooled specificity of 99.7%. A subgroup analysis ofthe studies performing the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) forparticipants from airports and public health centers revealed a pooledsensitivity of 93.6%. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that the salivaantigen test performed using CLEIA exhibited higher sensitivity for the detectionof SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the saliva antigen test performed using CLEIA might be an effective and noninvasive screening tool for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is rampant in Europe and the United States, andthe Delta variant has caused several small-scale outbreaks in China. It isparticularly important to simulate the transmission risk of novel coronaviruspneumonia (COVID-19) during large-scale events, so as to ensure a goodpreparation of personnel, materials, isolation sites and other support work inadvance. Taking the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games as an example, this studyintroduces the use of mathematical models to simulate the entry risks,closed-loop risks and prevention and control measures of athletes, officials and other stakeholders of the Olympic Games. In the simulation results on January 19,2022, the estimated number of Olympic Games-related infections who wereidentified at borders was 357 (95%CI: 153-568) and the observed number was 323.The estimated number of "seed" cases that entered the closed-loop of OlympicsGames was 195 (95%CI: 43-335), and the observed number of cases in theclosed-loop was 212. This study demonstrates the important role of mathematicalmodels of infectious diseases in the pragmatic application of preventive medicineand public health.

AB  - Background: Longitudinal studies are crucial for identifying potential riskfactors for infection with, and consequences of, COVID-19, but relationships can be biased if they are associated with invitation and response to data collection.We describe factors relating to questionnaire invitation and response in COVID-19questionnaire data collection in a multigenerational birth cohort (the AvonLongitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC). Methods: We analysed online questionnaires completed between the beginning of the pandemic and easing of the first UK lockdown by participants with valid email addresses who had not activelydisengaged from the study. We assessed associations of pre-pandemicsociodemographic, behavioural, anthropometric and health-related factors with: i)being sent a questionnaire; ii) returning a questionnaire; and iii) item response(for specific questions). Analyses were conducted in three cohorts: the indexchildren born in the early 1990s (now young adults; 41 variables assessed), theirmothers (35 variables) and the mothers' partners (27 variables). Results: Of14,849 young adults, 41% were sent a questionnaire, of whom 57% returned one.Item response was >95%. In this cohort, 78% of factors were associated with beingsent a questionnaire, 56% with returning one, and, as an example of itemresponse, 20% with keyworker status response. For instance, children from motherseducated to degree-level had greater odds of being sent a questionnaire (OR=5.59;95% CI=4.87-6.41), returning one (OR=1.60; 95% CI=1.31-1.95), and responding toitems (e.g., keyworker status OR=1.65; 95% CI=0.88-3.04), relative to childrenfrom mothers with fewer qualifications. Invitation and response rates andassociations were similar in all cohorts. Conclusions: These results highlightthe importance of considering potential biases due to non-response when usinglongitudinal studies in COVID-19 research and interpreting results. We recommend researchers report response rates and factors associated with invitation andresponse in all COVID-19 observational research studies, which can informsensitivity analyses.

PG  - 341
LID - 10.12688/f1000research.109398.2 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study aims to identify the preferred sources for acquiringknowledge about COVID-19 and to evaluate basic knowledge on critical scientificliterature appraisal in students from medical schools located in Spanish speakingcountries in Latin America. Methods: We designed an online survey of 15closed-ended questions related to demographics, preferred resources for COVID-19 training, and items to assess critical appraisal skills. A snowball method wasused for sampling. We conducted a descriptive analysis and Chi-squared tests tocompare the proportion of correct identification of the concept of a preprint anda predatory journal when considering a) self-perceived level of knowledge, b)public vs private school, c) inclusion of a scientific literature appraisalsubject in the curriculum, and d) progress in medical school. Results: Our sampleincluded 770 valid responses, out of which most of the participants included werefrom Mexico (n=283, 36.8%) and Ecuador (n=229, 29.7%). Participants preferredusing evidence-based clinical resources (EBCRs) to learn more about COVID-19(n=182, 23.6%). The preferred study design was case report/series (n=218, 28.1%).We found that only 265 participants correctly identified the concept of apreprint (34.4%), while 243 students (31.6%) correctly identified thecharacteristics of a predatory journal. We found no significant differences inthe proportion of correct answers regardless of the self-perceived level ofknowledge, progress in medical school, or scientific literature criticalappraisal classes. Conclusion: This study is novel in its approach of identifyingsources of knowledge used by Latin American medical students and providesinsights into the need to reinforce training in critical appraisal of scientific literature during medical school.

AB  - Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using availableresources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity ofCOVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of naturalproduct use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity andhospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan.Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were >/=18 years old were the studypopulation. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was usedfor statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean +/- SD) of the study sample(n=2,148) was 40.25 +/- 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37-0.85]), onion (OR[0.69], CI [0.52-0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51-0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR[0.66], CI [0.50-0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantialreduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR[0.55], CI [0.34-0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42-0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR[0.61], CI [0.44-0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in thefrequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regularconsumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection wasassociated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations arerequired to confirm these findings.

PG  - 1312
LID - 10.12688/f1000research.75891.2 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to produce community-level geo-spatial mapping of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario Canada in near real-time to supportdecision-making. This was accomplished by area-to-area geostatistical analysis,space-time integration, and spatial interpolation of COVID-19 positiveindividuals. Methods: COVID-19 cases and locations were curated forgeostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to thefirst, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregatedaccording to designated forward sortation area (FSA), and postal codes (PC) inmunicipal regions Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, andWindsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Moran's I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Moran's Iasymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolatedacross geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes highconcentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries.The Geostatistical Disease Epidemiology Toolbox, which is freely-availablesoftware, automates the identification of these regions and produces digital mapsfor public health professionals to assist in pandemic management of contacttracing and distribution of other resources. Results: This study providedindicators in real-time of likely, community-level disease transmission throughinnovative geospatial analyses of COVID-19 incidence data. Municipal andprovincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks atlong-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs,and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared todetermine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutivehotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission ofCOVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging.Results were also stratified by population based-categories (sex, age, andpresence/absence of comorbidities). Conclusions: Earlier recognition of hotspots could reduce public health burdens of COVID-19 and expedite contact tracing.

BTI - Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19
LID - 10.3768/rtipress.2021.rr.0045.2106 [doi]
AB  - This study leveraged existing data infrastructure and relationships from the Feedthe Future Senegal Naatal Mbay ("flourishing agriculture") project, funded by theUS Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by RTIInternational from 2015 to 2019. The research informed and empowered farmerorganizations to track and respond to rural households in 2020 as they faced the COVID-19 pandemic. Farmer organizations, with support from RTI and local ICT firmSTATINFO, administered a survey to a sample of 800 agricultural households thatare members of four former Naatal Mbay-supported farmer organizations in tworounds in August and October 2020. Focus group discussions were conducted withnetwork leadership pre- and post-data collection to contextualize the experience of the COVID-19 shock and to validate findings. The results showed that farmerswere already reacting to the effects of low rainfall during the 2019 growingseason and that COVID-19 compounded the shock through disrupted communicationsand interregional travel bans, creating food shortages and pressure to divertseed stocks for food. Food insecurity effects, measured through the HouseholdFood Insecurity Access Scale and cereals stocks, were found to be greater forhouseholds in the Casamance region than in the Kaolack and Kaffrine regions. The findings also indicate that farmer networks deployed a coordinated responsecomprising food aid and access to personal protective equipment, distribution of short-cycle legumes and grains (e.g., cowpea, maize) and vegetable seeds,protection measures for cereals seeds, and financial innovations with banks.However, food stocks were expected to recover as harvesting began in October2020, and the networks were planning to accelerate seed multiplication, diversifycrops beyond cereals, improve communication across the network. and mainstreamaccess to financial instruments in the 2021 growing season. The researchindicated that the previous USAID-funded project had likely contributed to thenetworks' COVID-19 resilience capacities by building social capital and fosteringthe new use of tools and technologies over the years it operated.

TI  - Working from home during COVID-19 in a Danish hospital research setting:experiences of researchers and healthcare providers, explored by Group ConceptMapping.
PG  - e063279
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063279 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the working environment, how wethink of it and how it stands to develop into the future. Knowledge about howpeople have continued to work on-site and adjusted to working from home duringthe COVID-19 lockdown will be vital for planning work arrangements in thepost-pandemic period. Our primary objective was to investigate experiences ofworking from home or having colleagues working from home during a late stage ofthe COVID-19 lockdown among researchers and healthcare providers in a hospitalresearch setting. Second, we aimed to investigate researchers' productivitythrough changes in various proxy measures during lockdown as compared withpre-lockdown. DESIGN: Mixed-method participatory Group Concept Mapping (GCM).SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: GCM, based on a mixed-method participatory approach,was applied involving researchers' and healthcare providers' online sorting andrating experiences working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. At aface-to-face meeting, participants achieved consensus on the number and labellingof domains-the basis for developing a conceptual model. RESULTS: Through the GCM approach, 47 participants generated 125 unique statements of experiences related to working from home, which were organised into seven clusters. Using theseclusters, we developed a conceptual model that illustrated the pros and cons ofworking from home. CONCLUSION: The future work setting, the role of the officeand the overall work environment need to respond to workers' increased wish forflexible work arrangements and co-decision.

PG  - e062388
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062388 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increased exposure to digital devices as part of online classesincreases susceptibility to visual impairments, particularly among schoolstudents taught using e-learning strategies. This study aimed to identify theimpact of remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown on children's visualhealth. DESIGN: Systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items forSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed andScienceDirect databases from the year 2020 onwards. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Weincluded cross-sectional, case-control, cohort studies, case series and casereports, published in English, Spanish or French, that approached the effects of remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown on visual health in neurotypicalchildren. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We included a total of 21 articles with previous quality assessments using the Joanna Briggs checklist. Risk of biasassessment was applied using the National Institutes of Health quality assessmenttool for before-and-after studies with no control group; the tool developed byHoy et al to assess cross-sectional studies; the Murad et al tool to evaluate themethodological quality of case reports and case series; and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. RESULTS: All but one study reported a deleteriousimpact of the COVID-19 lockdown on visual health in children. Overall, the mostfrequently identified ocular effects were refractive errors, accommodationdisturbances and visual symptoms such as dry eye and asthenopia. CONCLUSIONS:Increased dependence on digital devices for online classes has either induced or exacerbated visual disturbances, such as rapid progression of myopia, dry eye andvisual fatigue symptoms, and vergence and accommodation disturbances, in childrenwho engaged in remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown.

TI  - Development and validation of an early warning score to identify COVID-19 in the emergency department based on routine laboratory tests: a multicentrecase-control study.
PG  - e059111
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identifying patients with a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in theemergency department (ED) is challenging. Symptoms differ, incidence rates varyand test capacity may be limited. As PCR-testing all ED patients is neitherfeasible nor effective in most centres, a rapid, objective, low-cost earlywarning score to triage ED patients for a possible infection is developed.DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary hospitals in theNetherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients presenting to the ED with venous blood sampling from July 2019 to July 2020 (n=10 417, 279SARS-CoV-2-positive). The temporal validation cohort covered the period from July2020 to October 2021 (n=14 080, 1093 SARS-CoV-2-positive). The externalvalidation cohort consisted of patients presenting to the ED of three hospitalsin the Netherlands (n=12 061, 652 SARS-CoV-2-positive). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary outcome was one or more positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results within 1day prior to or 1 week after ED presentation. RESULTS: The resulting'CoLab-score' consists of 10 routine laboratory measurements and age. The scoreshowed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.930, 95% CI 0.909 to 0.945). Thelowest CoLab-score had high sensitivity for COVID-19 (0.984, 95% CI 0.970 to0.991; specificity: 0.411, 95% CI 0.285 to 0.520). Conversely, the highest score had high specificity (0.978, 95% CI 0.973 to 0.983; sensitivity: 0.608, 95% CI0.522 to 0.685). The results were confirmed in temporal and external validation. CONCLUSIONS: The CoLab-score is based on routine laboratory measurements and isavailable within 1 hour after presentation. Depending on the prevalence, COVID-19may be safely ruled out in over one-third of ED presentations. Highly suspectcases can be identified regardless of presenting symptoms. The CoLab-score iscontinuous, in contrast to the binary outcome of lateral flow testing, and canguide PCR testing and triage ED patients.

LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063935 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) booster dosesduring the period of Delta and Omicron variant dominance. DESIGN: We conducted a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the vaccine effectiveness(VE) of three and two doses of mRNA vaccines against infection (regardless ofsymptoms) and against COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. SETTING:Veterans Health Administration. PARTICIPANTS: We used electronic health recorddata from 114 640 veterans who had a SARS-CoV-2 test during November 2021-January2022. Patients were largely 65 years or older (52%), male (88%) and non-Hispanic white (59%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First positive result for a SARS-CoV-2 PCR orantigen test. RESULTS: Against infection, booster doses had higher estimated VE(64%, 95% CI 63 to 65) than two-dose vaccination (12%, 95% CI 10 to 15) duringthe Omicron period. For the Delta period, the VE against infection was 90% (95%CI 88 to 92) among boosted vaccinees, higher than the VE among two-dose vaccinees(54%, 95% CI 50 to 57). Against hospitalisation, booster dose VE was 89% (95% CI 88 to 91) during Omicron and 94% (95% CI 90 to 96) during Delta; two-dose VE was 63% (95% CI 58 to 67) during Omicron and 75% (95% CI 69 to 80) during Delta.Against death, the VE with a booster dose was 94% (95% CI 90 to 96) duringOmicron and 96% (95% CI 87 to 99) during Delta. CONCLUSIONS: Among an older,mostly male, population with comorbidities, we found that an mRNA vaccine boosterwas highly effective against infection, hospitalisation and death. Although theeffectiveness of booster vaccination against infection was moderately higheragainst Delta than against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant, effectiveness against severe disease and death was similarly high against both variants.

TI  - Well-Being Among Respiratory Therapists in an Academic Medical Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - respcare.10094 [pii]
LID - 10.4187/respcare.10094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed high rates of burnout among respiratory therapists (RTs), which has implications for patient care and outcomes as well asfor the health care workforce. We sought to better understand RT well-beingduring the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine ratesand identify determinants of well-being, including burnout and professionalfulfillment, among RTs in ICUs. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods studycomprised of a survey administered quarterly from July 2020-May 2021 tocritical-care health care professionals and semi-structured interviews fromApril-May 2021 with 10 ICU RTs within a single health center. We performedmultivariable analyses to compare RT well-being to other professional groups and to evaluate changes in well-being over time. We analyzed qualitative interviewdata using thematic analysis, followed by mapping themes to the Maslow needshierarchy. RESULTS: One hundred and eight RTs responded to at least one quarterlysurvey. Eighty-two (75%) experienced burnout; 39 (36%) experienced professionalfulfillment, and 62 (58%) reported symptoms of depression. Compared to cliniciansof other professions in multivariable analyses, RTs were significantly morelikely to experience burnout (odds ratio 2.32 [95% CI 1.41-3.81]) and depression (odds ratio 2.73 [95% CI 1.65-4.51]) and less likely to experience fulfillment(odds ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.31-0.85]). We found that staffing challenges, safetyconcerns, workplace conflict, and lack of work-life balance led to burnout.Patient care, use of specialized skills, appreciation and a sense of community atwork, and purpose fostered professional fulfillment. Themes identified weremapped to Maslow's hierarchy of needs; met needs led to professional fulfillment,and unmet needs led to burnout. CONCLUSIONS: ICU RTs experienced burnout duringthe pandemic at rates higher than other professions. To address RT needs,institutions should design and implement strategies to reduce burnout across all levels.

TI  - Burnout Among Respiratory Therapists Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - respcare.10144 [pii]
LID - 10.4187/respcare.10144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burnout is a major challenge in health care and is associated withpoor overall well-being, increased medical errors, worse patient outcomes, andlow job satisfaction. There is scant literature focused on the respiratorytherapist's (RT) experience of burnout, and a thorough exploration of RTs'perception of factors associated with burnout has not been reported. The aim ofthis qualitative study was to understand the factors associated with burnout asexperienced by RTs amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a post hoc, qualitative analysis of free-text responses from a survey of burnout prevalencein RTs. RESULTS: There were 1,114 total and 220 free-text responses. Fiveoverarching themes emerged from the analysis: staffing, workload,physical/emotional consequences, lack of effective leadership, and lack ofrespect. Respondents discussed feelings of anxiety, depression, and compassionfatigue as well as concerns that lack of adequate staffing, high workloadassignments, and inadequate support from leadership contributed to feelings ofburnout. Specific instances of higher patient acuity, surge in critically illpatients, rapidly evolving changes in treatment recommendations, and minimaltraining and preparation for an extended scope of practice were reported asstressors that led to burnout. Some respondents stated that they felt a lack ofrespect for both the RT profession and the contribution of RTs to patient care.CONCLUSIONS: Themes associated with burnout in RTs included staffing, workload,physical and emotional exhaustion, lack of effective leadership, and lack ofrespect. These results provide potential targets for interventions to combatburnout among RTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the COVID-19pandemic and the instructional changes implemented in response to it affectedstudent enrollment, retention, or success on the National Board for RespiratoryCare credentialing examinations at an associate degree respiratory care programin the state of Texas. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of student enrollment,retention data, and graduate success rates on the National Board for Respiratory Care credentialing examinations were used in this study. The data were collected from an associate degree respiratory care program in Texas and included 69graduates for the 5-year study period. The 3 academic years that led up to theCOVID-19 pandemic served as a "pre-pandemic" baseline for comparison. The cohort of 2019-2020 was labeled "early pandemic," the cohort of 2020-2021 was labeled"mid pandemic," and the cohort of 2021-2022 was labeled "late pandemic" for data comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and theMann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis (P < .05). RESULTS: The number ofprogram applicants significantly decreased between the pre- and late-pandemicgroups (P = .001), but overall student enrollment (P = .42) and retention (P =.95) were not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first-timepass rate on the Therapist Multiple-Choice examination low-cut score (P = .005)and high-cut score (P = .007) were significantly reduced in the mid-pandemicgroup when compared with the previous cohorts. There were no statisticallysignificant differences in the demographic data or online questionnaire responsesfrom the early- and mid-pandemic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic andthe instructional changes implemented in response to it decreased students'first-time pass rate on the Therapist Multiple-Choice examination in themid-pandemic group compared with the pre- and early-pandemic groups.

It also sought to evaluatethe relationship between each of the variables studied (anxiety, depression,sociodemographic and COVID-19 variables) and the dimensions of the burnout.BACKGROUND: One of the groups of health care workers worst affected by theCOVID-19 crisis has been women working as nursing staff, due to the highpercentage they account for at a global level and their direct contact withinfected patients. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study.METHODS: Four hundred forty-four Spanish female nurses from hospital and primary health care centres took part in the study. The data were obtained in 2020 bymeans of an online survey. RESULTS: Symptoms of depression are a common predictorvariable to all the dimensions of burnout, whereas symptoms of anxiety predictemotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Age and years of experience in thejob predict depersonalization, whereas the probability of contracting theinfection is a predictor variable of emotional exhaustion and personalaccomplishment. CONCLUSION: Predictor variables should be considered in thecreation of prevention and intervention plans to reduce the levels of burnout in female nurses.

AB  - Background: Biologics are the cornerstone of therapy in children and adolescents with severe or uncontrolled allergic diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis,and chronic urticaria. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection a pandemic inMarch 2020, some scientific societies have released statements on the use ofbiologics in allergic children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: Given the very limited data in Italy on use of biological therapies in allergic childrenand adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, amulticenter observational nationwide survey was conducted to collect thisinformation. The 11-question survey was designed to determine (1) the number ofallergic children and adolescents treated with omalizumab, mepolizumab, ordupilumab for asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic urticaria; (2) the number ofthese patients who developed COVID-19; and (3) severity of COVID-19 symptoms.Twenty pediatric centers participated, and data were collected from February toApril 2020. Results: Three hundred eight children and adolescents (mean age 12.8 years, 161 males) were treated with biologics. Only 3 subjects (1%) who had been treated with omalizumab experienced paucisymptomatic COVID-19, but those symptomspromptly resolved. Of the 9 patients treated with mepolizumab, none had COVID-19 or asthma exacerbations. Of the 6 asthmatic subjects and 7 patients with chronic urticaria treated with dupilumab, none had COVID-19. Also, there was no worseningof the underlying disease. Conclusion: These very preliminary outcomes suggestthat continuing biologics seem to be safe. Therefore, biologics could becontinued in patients with severe allergic diseases, but withheld once contractedCOVID-19.

AB  - Older adults in nursing homes are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortalityfrom SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nursing home residents constituted one-third to morethan half of all deaths during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.Following this, widespread adaptation of infection prevention and controlmeasures and the supply and use of personal protective equipment resulted in asignificant decrease in nursing home infections and deaths. For nursing homes,the most important determinant of experiencing a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the firstinstance appears to be community-transmission levels (particularly with variants of concern), although nursing home size and quality, for-profit status, andsociodemographic characteristics are also important. Use of visitation bans,imposed to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on residents, must be delicatelybalanced against their impact on resident, friend or family, and staffwell-being. The successful rollout of primary vaccination has resulted in a sharpdecrease in morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes. However,emerging evidence suggests that vaccine efficacy may wane over time, and the use of a third or additional vaccine "booster" doses in nursing home residentsrestores protection afforded by primary vaccination. Ongoing monitoring ofvaccine efficacy in terms of infection, morbidity, and mortality is crucial inthis vulnerable group in informing ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boostingstrategies. Here, we detail the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on nursing home residentsand discuss important considerations in the management of nursing home SARS-CoV-2outbreaks. We additionally examine the use of testing strategies,nonpharmacologic outbreak control measures and vaccination strategies in thiscohort. Finally, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the sector is reflected on as weemphasize the need for adoption of universal standards of medical care andintegration with wider public health infrastructure in nursing homes in order to provide a safe and effective long-term care sector.

TI  - Coronaviruses exploit a host cysteine-aspartic protease for replication.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05148-4 [doi]
AB  - Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1,2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)(3), and SARS-CoV-1(4) vary in their transmissibility andpathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantialapoptosis in cell culture(5-7) and in patient tissues(8-10), suggesting apotential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstratethat caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating Nfragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virusreplication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves thesurvival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoVMA)-infected human DPP4 knock-in(hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a componentof the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A limited number of studies have shown a decline in antibody titersin healthcare workers beyond six months after the second dose of the BNT162b2vaccine, and has been insufficiently investigated yet in the respective Asianethnic groups. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study on 187healthcare workers and other personnel and healthy adults at least eight monthsafter vaccination at the International University of Health and Welfare. RESULTS:The baseline (before the third dose of BNT162b2) anti-receptor binding domain(RBD) IgG level was 569[377-943] AU/mL 245[240-250] days after the second dose.The mean antibody titer of participants aged 20-29 years was 4.6 times higherthan that of participants aged 70-79 years. After booster vaccination, serumanti-RBD antibody levels were elevated in all participants with a median titer of23,250[14,612-33,401] AU/mL 21[19-23] days after the third dose. The medianpost-booster antibody titers in the 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years age groups were 30.6, 33.0, 33.8, 27.4, 50.1, and 90.3 times, respectively,higher than the pre-booster ones. Antibody levels were 15% lower in dailydrinkers compared to nondrinkers, suggesting that daily alcohol consumption canprevent antibody levels from increasing after vaccination. Our results showdecreased antibody titers after two doses of the vaccine, especially in theelderly; however, the third dose of the vaccine resulted in a significantincrease in antibody titers in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: We providedinformation on antibody responses following primary and booster doses of theBNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in Japan.

AB  - The pulmonary pathological findings associated with severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) result from the release of multipleproinflammatory cytokines, which causes the subsequential damage of the lungs.The current study was undertaken to investigate the responses of mast cells toviral inoculation and their contribution to host defenses from the point of view of viral entry. Pseudovirions, in which the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was incorporated, triggered activation of mast cells, and a mast cell-derivedchymase, MCP2, formed a complex with spike protein, which promotedprotease-dependent viral entry. According to the quantification results of viral entry, 10muM quercetin, a mast cell stabilizer, potentially potently inhibited41.3% of viral entry, while 100muM chymostatin, which served as a chymaseinhibitor, suppressed 52.1% of viral entry, compared to non-treated cells. Study using mast cell-deficient mice showed that the absence of mast cells mayinfluence early viral loading in the upper respiratory tract, which consequently increases the risk of viral invasion into the lower respiratory system.Furthermore, mast cell-deficient mice exhibited ongoing infection in the latephase post-viral inoculation, while clearance of virus-positive cells wasobserved in wild-type mice. In conclusion, mast cells act as a multifacetedimmune modulator that is equipped with both protective effects and pathogenicinfluences on viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. The utility of mast cell stabilizers andchymase inhibitors in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratorysyndrome should be optimized regarding the infection stage and the risk ofcytokine storm.

AB  - We compared the clinical course of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) before and after the emergence of the omicron variant and based onvaccination status. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical charts of 224 patients and 82 deliveries from November 1, 2020, to March 7, 2022; of these,42% were diagnosed during the omicron dominance period. Disease severity andmorbidity of COVID-19 were significantly decreased during the omicron era. Thevaccination rates among the patients were higher after omicron emergence (31.9%) than before (6.9%). Overall, 4.1% and 25% of patients had severe symptoms, and2.6% and 16.2% required oxygen therapy in the vaccination and non-vaccinationgroups, respectively. Overall, patients had a more favorable clinical course inthe omicron era; moreover, vaccinated patients were better protected thannon-vaccinated patients, indicating the importance of vaccination againstCOVID-19.

TI  - Feasibility of a new lung ultrasound protocol to determine the extent of lunginjury in COVID-19 pneumonia.
LID - S0012-3692(22)01344-7 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound (LUS) is useful to diagnose and assess the severityof pulmonary lesions during CoViD-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CoARDS). A conventional LUS score is proposed to measure the loss of aerationduring CoARDS. However, this score was validated during the pre-COVID-19 era inARDS patients in intensive care and does not consider the differences withCoARDS. An alternative LUS method is based on grading the percentage of extensionof the typical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on the lung surface (LUSext). RESEARCHQUESTION: Is LUSext feasible in COVID-19 patients at onset of disease and does itcorrelate with the volumetric measure of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia lesionsat computed tomography (CTvol)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: This observational studyenrolled a convenience sampling of patients in the emergency department withconfirmed COVID-19 and demonstration of pneumonia at bedside LUS and CT scan.LUSext was visually quantified. All CT studies were retrospectively analyzed by aspecifically designed software to calculate the CTvol. The correlation betweenLUSext and CTvol, and the correlations of each score with PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F)were calculated. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 179 patients. Feasibility ofLUSext was 100%. Time to perform LUS scan was 5 + 1.5 mins. LUSext and CTvol werepositively correlated, with R = 0.67, P < 0.0001. Both LUSext and CTvol showednegative correlation with P/F, respectively with R = -0.66 and R = -0.54; P<0.0001. INTERPRETATION: LUSext is a valid measure of the severity of the lesionswhen compared to CT scan. Not only are LUSext and CTvol correlated, but they alsohave similar inverse correlation with the severity of respiratory failure. LUSextis a practical and simple bedside measure of the severity of pneumonia in CoARDS,whose clinical and prognostic impact need to be further investigated.

AB  - The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses mediates host cell entry and is S-acylated on multiple phylogenetically conserved cysteine residues.Multiple protein acyltransferase enzymes have been reported topost-translationally modify Spike proteins; however, strategies to exploit thismodification are currently lacking. Using resin-assisted capture massspectrometry, we demonstrate here the Spike protein is S-acylated inSARS-CoV-2-infected human and monkey cells. We further show increased abundanceof the human acyltransferase ZDHHC5 associates with increased S-acylation of the Spike protein, whereas ZDHHC5 knockout cells had a 40% reduction in theincorporation of an alkynyl-palmitate using click chemistry detection. We alsofind the S-acylation of the Spike protein is not limited to palmitate, asclickable versions of myristate and stearate were also found on theimmunocaptured protein. Yet, we observed ZDHHC5 was only modified when incubated with alkyne-palmitate, suggesting it has specificity for this acyl-CoA, and that other ZDHHC enzymes may use additional fatty acids to modify the Spike protein.Since multiple ZDHHC isoforms may modify the Spike protein, we also examined the ability of the fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-3166 to prevent S-acylation ofthe Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and human CoV-229E. We show treating cells with TVB-3166 inhibited S-acylation of ectopically expressed Spike and attenuated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and human CoV-229E to spread in vitro. Our findings furthersubstantiate the necessity of CoV Spike protein S-acylation and demonstrate that de novo fatty acid synthesis is critical for the proper S-acylation of the Spike protein.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prior research identified a significant decline in the number ofabortions in Louisiana at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well asincreases in second-trimester abortions and decreases in medication abortions.This study examines how service disruptions in particular areas of the statedisparately affected access to abortion care based on geography. STUDY DESIGN: Wecollected monthly service data from Louisiana's abortion clinics (January2018-May 2020) and conducted mystery client calls to determine whether clinicswere scheduling appointments at pandemic onset (April-May 2020). We usedsegmented regression to assess whether service disruptions modified the mainpandemic effects on the number, timing and type of abortions using stratifiedmodels and interaction terms. Additionally, we calculated the median distancethat Louisiana residents traveled to the clinic where they obtained care.RESULTS: For residents whose closest clinic was consistently schedulingappointments at the onset of the pandemic, the number of monthly abortions didnot change [IRR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.84-1.36]. For those whose closest clinic serviceswere disrupted, the number of monthly abortions decreased by 46% [IRR=0.54, 95%CI: 0.45-0.65]. Similarly, increases in second-trimester abortions and decreases in medication abortions were concentrated in areas where residents experiencedservice disruptions [AOR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.21-4.56 and AOR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.29-0.87,respectively] and were not seen elsewhere in the state. CONCLUSION: Changes inthe number, timing and type of abortions were concentrated among residents inparticular areas of Louisiana. The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemicexacerbated geographic disparities in access to abortion care.

AB  - In 2020, a state of emergency (SOE) was enforced by the Japanese government,which included temporary school closures with the aim of overcoming COVID-19spread, which prevented access to school lunches. We evaluated the relationshipbetween meal quality and guardians' literacy of meal preparation for a nationallyrepresentative sample of 1107 Japanese schoolchildren (aged 10-14 years) before, during, and after the SOE on the basis of 7 questions scored using a 5-pointLikert scale. The guardians' literacy of meal preparation for children wasdivided into quartiles, with Q1 and Q4 including participants with the lowest andhighest scores on food literacy, respectively. School lunch menu was handed outmonthly to each household by their classroom teacher. The consumption of (i)meat, fish, or eggs and (ii) vegetables at least twice a day indicated"well-balanced dietary intake", which was less frequent in all four quartiles,especially for Q1 and Q2, during compared to before the SOE. The relative riskincreases (95% CI) were Q1: -40.6% (-41.4% to -39.8%; p<0.001), Q2: -34.0%(-34.7% to -33.3%; p<0.001), Q3: -13.1% (-13.8% to -12.4%; p<0.001), and Q4:-15.3% (-16.0% to -14.7%; p<0.001), adjusted for sex, age, BMI, equivalent incomeadjusted for the number of household members, and educational level of parents.The interaction p was <0.001 for Q1-3 vs. Q4. Guardians with low total scoreswere significantly more likely to have less time, mental capacity, and financial ability to prepare meals after the SOE. Therefore, schoolchildren's meal quality deteriorated during the SOE, particularly among those with guardians with lowfood literacy even after adjustment for household income level and guardians'educational level.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in COVID-19 preventionand treatment but are challenged by viral evolution and the emergence of novelescape variants. Importantly, the recently identified Omicron sublineagesBA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 are rapidly becoming predominant in various countries. Bydetermining polyclonal serum activity of 50 convalescent or vaccinatedindividuals against BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5, we reveal afurther reduction in BA.4/5 susceptibility to vaccinee sera. Most notably,delineation of sensitivity to an extended 163-antibody panel demonstratespronounced antigenic differences with distinct escape patterns among Omicronsublineages. Antigenic distance and/or higher resistance may therefore favorimmune-escape-mediated BA.4/5 expansion after the first Omicron wave. Finally,while most clinical-stage monoclonal antibodies are inactive against Omicronsublineages, we identify promising antibodies with high pan-SARS-CoV-2neutralizing potency. Our study provides a detailed understanding ofOmicron-sublineage antibody escape that can inform on effective strategiesagainst COVID-19.

AB  - Although COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, multiple pathogenic coronavirusspecies exist, urging on development of multispecies coronavirus vaccines. Herewe develop prototype lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccine candidates againstSARS-CoV-2 Delta, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, and we test how multiplexing LNP-mRNAs can induce effective immune responses in animal models. Triplex and duplexLNP-mRNA vaccinations induce antigen-specific antibody responses againstSARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles theglobal systemic immune repertoires and respective transcriptome signatures ofvaccinated animals, revealing a systemic increase in activated B cells anddifferential gene expression across major adaptive immune cells. Sequentialvaccination shows potent antibody responses against all three species,significantly stronger than simultaneous vaccination in mixture. These datademonstrate the feasibility, antibody responses, and single-cell immune profiles of multispecies coronavirus vaccination. The direct comparison betweensimultaneous and sequential vaccination offers insights into optimization ofvaccination schedules to provide broad and potent antibody immunity against threemajor pathogenic coronavirus species.

TI  - Risk factors influencing seroconversion after inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people living with obesity.
LID - 10.1159/000525555 [doi]
AB  - Introduction To investigate the antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spikeantigens, and the risk factors affecting antibody levels in people living withobesity (PwO) after inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Corona Vac) administration.Methods 169 consecutive patients with obesity who visited the Center for Obesity Management at Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical FacultyHospitals, between May and August 2021, were invited to the study. The non-obese control group was recruited from 191 subjects who visited the CerrahpasaHospitals Vaccination Unit. The study group and the non-obese control group have already received two doses of inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgGNucleocapsid Antibody Antibody Test was administered to patients and controlsubjects to discover those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourty onepatients who had prior infection and received two doses of vaccine were alsoincluded in the study as a subgroup. Blood samples were taken on the 3rd to 4thweek after the second vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers were determinedby quantitative serological methods. Results Antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2spike antigen of individuals with BMI 30.0 kg/m2 were significantly lower thanthose with BMI<30 kg/m2 (p= 0.001) in the study group. Moreover, the antibodytiters in people with BMI 30.0 kg/m2 were significantly lower than in thosehaving a BMI<30.0 kg/m2 in the subgroup (p=0.03). Age (p=0.03), BMI (p=0.006) andhypertension (p=0.03) were found to be independent risk factors for antibodyresponse in people living with obesity. Women with non-prior SARS-CoV-2 infectionshowed a significantly higher antibody response then men (p=0.001). ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 -Immunoglobulin G antibody levels against inactive (CoronaVac) vaccinewere found to be lower in people living with obesity (PwO) compared to non-obese individuals. Antibody titers may be measured and booster doses should bedelivered accordingly in PwO for optimal protection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most U.S. medical schoolsacutely transitioned from regimented in-person learning to highly flexiblevirtual asynchronous learning. This transition at our medical school provided aunique opportunity to evaluate if and how students adapted their academic andpersonal lives in response. METHODS: Medical students in a single class that madethis transition were retrospectively provided with 24-hour diaries for threeperiods - one shortly before the transition, a second early in the transition,and third several months into the transition - and asked to select the academicor personal activities done in each hour. The percentage of medical studentsperforming each activity each hour was analyzed, as was the time spent on eachactivity per day, and per morning, afternoon, per evening within the day.RESULTS: Overall study time did not change in either virtual period but shiftedsignificantly to the morning (6 AM to 12 PM). Time spent studying in groups fell significantly during both virtual periods, concordant with a significant increasein alone study time in the early virtual period. Early in the transition tovirtual learning, students replaced in-person didactics with online facultylectures; several months later in virtual learning, they had replaced onlinefaculty lectures with commercial products. There was no significant change intime spent on specific personal activities. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent withextensive constraints imposed by the heavy cognitive load of a medical schoolcurriculum, students did not significantly change their overall study time andany self-care-related activities in the transition to virtual learning. However, transitioning to virtual learning allowed our students to adapt their studystrategies, i.e. reducing group study time and increasing lone studying time.Furthermore, students shifted studying time to the morning to optimize themanagement of the cognitive task-load they faced.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 easily infects human monocytes, macrophages and possibly dendriticcells (DCs), causing dysfunctions of these important antigen presenting cells(APCs). Observed DC dysfunctions facilitate improper antigen presentation, which obviously results T cell anergy, exhaustion and apoptosis, thus, may becontributing significantly in SARS-CoV-2 infection associated lymphopenia. NeemLeaf Glycoprotein or NLGP has enormous role in altered DC functions, thereby,offering optimum T cell mediated cytotoxicity, as experienced from cancer system.Such NLGP guided correction of altered DCs might also be effective to generateproper SARS-CoV-2-specific effector and central memory T cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to address the association betweeninterstitial lung disease and the risk for severity and mortality among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The electronic databases ofPubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were systematically searched. The pooled effectsize with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was computed by a random-effectsmeta-analysis model. Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis,meta-regression analysis, Begg's test and Egger's test were performed. RESULTS: Atotal of sixteen eligible studies with 217,260 COVID-19 patients were enrolled inthis meta-analysis. The findings based on adjusted effect estimates indicatedthat pre-existing interstitial lung disease was significantly associated withhigher risk for COVID-19 severity (pooled effect = 1.34 [95 % CI: 1.16-1.55]) andmortality (pooled effect = 1.26 [95 % CI: 1.09-1.46]). Consistent results wereobserved in the subgroup analysis stratified by sample size, age, the percentage of male patients, study design, setting, the methods for adjustment and thefactors for adjustment. The results of meta-regression demonstrated that samplesize, age and region might be the potential sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivityanalysis exhibited that our results were stable and robust. No publication biaswas observed in Egger's test and Begg's test. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis onthe basis of adjusted effect estimates demonstrated that pre-existinginterstitial lung disease was independently associated with significantly higher risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected cancercare and research by disrupting the prevention and treatment paths as well as thepreclinical, clinical, and translational research ecosystem. In Italy, this hasbeen particularly significant given the severity of the pandemic's impact and theintrinsic vulnerabilities of the national health system. However, whilstdetrimental, disruption can also be constructive and may stimulate innovation andprogress. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) has recognized theimpact of COVID-19 on cancer care continuum and research and proposes the '2021Matera statement' which aims at providing pragmatic guidance for policymakers andhealth care institutions to mitigate the impact of the global health crisis onItalian oncology and design the recovery plan for the post-pandemic scenario. Theinterventions are addressed both to the pillars (prevention, diagnosis,treatment, follow-up, health care professionals) and foundations of cancer care(communication and care relationship, system organization, resources, research,networking). The priorities to be implemented can be summarized in the MATERAacronym: Multidisciplinarity; Access to cancer care; Telemedicine andTerritoriality; Equity, ethics, education; Research and resources; Alliancebetween stakeholders and patients.

TI  - Students' Perceptions, Educational Challenges, and Hope during the COVID-19Pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/cch.13036 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of U.S. students bothat home and at school; Little is known regarding how adolescents perceiveCOVID-19 has impacted (both positively and negatively) their academic and social lives, and how protective factors, such as hope, may assist with resilience.Importantly, not all pandemic experiences are necessarily negative, and positive perceptions, as well as potential protective factors, are key to understandingthe pandemic's role in students' lives. METHOD: Utilizing quantitative andqualitative approaches, the present study descriptively examined 726 6th through 12th grade (51% female, 53% white) students' perceptions of how COVID-19 related to educational and life disruptions, and positive aspects of their lives, within the United States. Analyses additionally explored the role of pre-pandemic hopein improving feelings of school connectedness during the pandemic. RESULTS:Results showed that most students felt that switching to online learning had beendifficult and their education had suffered at least moderately, with a sizableproportion of students feeling less academic motivation compared to last year.When asked to share qualitative answers regarding perceived challenges andpositive aspects of life, themes were consistent with quantitative perceptions.Students' pre-pandemic hope positively predicted students' feelings of schoolconnectedness. CONCLUSIONS: Findings paint a complex picture of youth's COVID-19 experiences and have implications for proactive ways to support students asCOVID-19 continues to affect daily life and educational structures and practices.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Minority populations in the United States face a disproportionateburden of illness from COVID-19 infection and have lower vaccination ratescompared with other groups. This study estimated the equity implications ofincreased COVID-19 vaccination in the United States, with a focus on the numberof cases, hospitalizations, and deaths avoided. STUDY DESIGN: This was anobservational real-world modeling study. METHODS: Data from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used to identify the remainingunvaccinated US population by county, age, and race as of October 22, 2021. Thenumber of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths avoided were calculatedbased on case incidence and death data from the CDC, along with data on race- andage-specific hospitalization multipliers, under a scenario in which half of theremaining unvaccinated population per county, race, and age group obtained a fullvaccine regimen. RESULTS: Vaccinating half of the remaining unvaccinatedpopulation in each age and race subgroup within counties would result in anestimated 22.09 million COVID-19 cases avoided, 1.38 million hospitalizationsavoided, and 150,000 deaths avoided over 12 months. Some minority groups,particularly Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, were projected to experience substantial benefits from increased vaccination rates as they face both lowervaccination rates and worse outcomes if infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS:Increasing COVID-19 vaccination in the United States not only benefits thepopulation as a whole but also serves as a potentially useful lever to reduce thedisproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness among minority populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, internal European borders weretemporarily re-established to mitigate the outbreak. Much research on pandemicborder control measures has focused on quantifying their effectiveness forinfectious disease control as well as on their social consequences forcross-border life in the European Union. However, little attention has been paid to the impacts for the practice and organisation of cross-border public health.To address this gap, the present study analysed the experiences and perspectives of public health professionals working in European border regions regardingborder control measures in the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitativeinterview-based study. METHODS: In total, 27 semistructured interviews withpublic health professionals were conducted in the border regions between Germany,the Netherlands and Belgium. Participants were asked about their perspectives on border control and the spread of COVID-19 in the region. Interviews wereperformed between December 2020 and April 2021 and carried out in German,English, Dutch and French. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, borders hadbecome largely invisible with extensive cross-border social life and mobility.Participants were sceptical about the role of cross-border mobility as a pandemicdriver and consequently the effectiveness of enforcing border control forreducing the spread of COVID-19 in their border regions. At the same time,participants raised concerns about the negative consequences for the socialfabric and provision of cross-border public health. CONCLUSIONS: Public healthprofessionals highlighted the uncertain role of border control measures forregional infectious disease control in border regions. Rather than bordercontrol, sustainable cross-border communication and collaboration is crucial toensure effective pandemic management in border regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse associations between theCOVID-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption and anxiety symptoms among people withself-reported disabilities and family caregivers in Latin America and theCaribbean. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with secondary data analysis ofthe 'Alcohol Use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and theCaribbean', a Web-based cross-sectional survey conducted by the Pan AmericanHealth Organisation between March and June 2020. METHODS: Descriptive analyseswere conducted on the individual, social environment characteristics, COVID-19infection, quarantine compliance, anxiety symptoms (measured by GeneralizedAnxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7]) and change in frequency of heavy episodicdrinking during the pandemic. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyseassociations among individuals with self-reported disabilities with anxietysymptoms and change in frequency of heavy episodic drinking during the pandemic. RESULTS: Family caregivers were more compliant with COVID-19 restrictive measuresthan individuals with and without disabilities. The majority of participants withdisabilities did not change their drinking patterns during the pandemic (64.3%); however, 28.1% reported increased consumption. People with disabilities were 2.17times more likely to have severe anxiety symptoms than no anxiety symptomsbetween March and June 2020 in Latin America and the Caribbean. CONCLUSIONS: Thisstudy observed a higher prevalence of the maintenance of heavy episodic drinking behaviour during the early phase of the pandemic in people with disabilities and family caregivers than in people without self-reported disabilities in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean. People with disabilities showed more severe anxietysymptoms than those without disabilities, highlighting the need to developinclusive health and quality-of-life policies to mitigate the effects of thepandemic in this vulnerable population.

TI  - Contextual forces shaping home-based healthcare services between 2010 and 2020:Insights from the social-ecological model and organizational theory.
LID - gnac113 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnac113 [doi]
AB  - Demands for home-based care have surged alongside population aging, preferencesfor aging in place, policy-driven reforms incentivizing lower hospitalutilization, and public concerns around COVID-19 transmissions in institutionalcare settings. However, at both macro and micro levels, sociopolitical andinfrastructural contexts are not aligned with the operational needs of homehealthcare organizations, presenting obstacles to home healthcare equity. Weintegrate the social-ecological model and organizational theory to highlightcontextual forces shaping the delivery of home-based care services between 2010and 2020. Placing home-based healthcare organizations at the center ofobservation, we discuss patterns and trends of service delivery as systematicorganizational behaviors reflecting the organizations' adaptations and responses to their surrounding forces. In this light, we consider the implications ofprovision and access to home care services for health equity, discuss topics thatare understudied, and provide recommendations for home-based healthcareorganizations to advance home healthcare equity. The paper represents a synthesisof recent literature and our research and industry experiences.

TI  - ENDOGENOUS FUNGAL ENDOPHTHALMITIS FOLLOWING COVID-19 INFECTION: CASE REPORT ANDREVIEW OF LITERATURE.
LID - 10.1097/ICB.0000000000001306 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a case of endogenous endophthalmitis (EE) following severeCOVID-19 disease, review patient outcomes with EE following COVID-19 infection,review evidence regarding risk factors for developing EE. METHODS: Review ofhealth records, imaging, intravitreal injection, and pars plana vitrectomy forbilateral fungal EE following severe COVID-19 disease. Literature review onoutcomes in EE following COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: 63 year-old male withdiabetes and hypertension was admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 diseasefor 3 months. His stay required ICU admission, intubation, high-dosecorticosteroids, tocilizumab, and was complicated by bacteremia, empyema, andfungal esophagitis. He developed floaters and bilateral vision loss (visualacuity 20/40 OD, CF OS) with vitritis 2.5 months into his stay that did notrespond to intravitreal voriconazole. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed forboth eyes, resulting in visual acuity of 20/40 OD, 20/30 OS. Vitreous cultureswere positive for candida albicans. EE following COVID-19 disease has beenreported in 22 patients to date, and outcomes are poor, with 40%+ of eyes legallyblind (20/200 or worse). Although influenced by availability of imagingmodalities and degree of training of the evaluating physician, misdiagnosis canaffect (1/4) of cases, delaying treatment. Age, male gender, and diabetesincrease risk of severe COVID-19, which requires prolonged hospitalization,invasive catheretization, and immunosuppression, which in turn increases risk of nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: Low threshold for suspecting endogenousendophthalmitis in patients presenting with floaters and decreased visionfollowing severe COVID-19 disease is necessary to ensure prompt recognition andtreatment.

AB  - As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues globally, there arean increasing number of pediatric cases. Since the initial symptoms of COVID-19may overlap and co-exist with other respiratory infections typically affectingchildren, this review examines the use of computed tomography as a diagnostic andmanagement tool. Children with preexisting conditions may be particularly proneto a more severe course. This study reviews and analytically summarizes thefindings typically associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in contrast with other more usual lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agentof the disease COVID-19, first emerged in late December 2019 in China, and hassubsequently become a pandemic with unprecedented clinical impact. The virusappears to more severely affect older individuals and those with co-morbidmedical conditions, specifically those with chronic lung disease, obesity, heart failure and diabetes. Fortunately, children appear to be less severely affected, though mortality and severe disease have been reported. In addition, children'srole in spreading the disease (potentially through asymptomatic shedding of thevirus) remains an important area requiring further investigation. The emergenceof SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the importance of metagenomic next generationsequencing as a tool for pandemic investigation. Though no proven therapeuticoptions currently exist, ongoing genomic and clinical trial data may help inform the identification and development of both repurposed and novel therapeuticagents for use in this disease.

LID - 10.1089/ped.2020.1241 [doi]
AB  - Background: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)pandemic is a health care emergency across the world. Although mitigationmeasures, such as social distancing and face masks, have attempted to slow thespread of the infection, cases continue to rise. Children who are otherwisehealthy tend to develop a milder acute Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)infection and have lower mortality rates compared with adults. Methods:Guidelines and current primary and secondary literature on the treatment ofCOVID-19 and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were searched and reviewed. There are 6 published pediatric series that included 252 children with acute COVID-19 infection and describe various treatments and outcomes. Results:Guidelines recommend treating pediatric patients similarly to adult patients.Currently, no prophylactic drug therapy has been shown to reduce the spread ofinfection. Treatment options for acute COVID-19 are limited to remdesivir andglucocorticoids for patients who require oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation.The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin has not beenproven and their safety has been a concern. Other therapies that are beingexplored include interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibitors. In children, an atypicalKawasaki-like disease emerged after recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and has beennamed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Nine case series,including 418 pediatric patients, described pharmacotherapies used and patientoutcomes. These pharmacotherapies included intravenous immune globulin andglucocorticoids and in some patients, IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors. Conclusion: Giventhe paucity of data in children, this article presents currently recommendedpharmacotherapies for the treatment of acute COVID-19 infection in adult patientsand whenever available, in pediatric patients. Pharmacotherapies used in thetreatment of MIS-C in children are also reviewed.

TI  - Pediatric Asthma Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a NationalSurvey.
PG  - 199-203
LID - 10.1089/ped.2020.1250 [doi]
AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic specialists were concerned about how to achieve the best control of pediatric asthmatic patients. Methods: A nationalsurvey was performed. Analysis of the mean of follow-up, complementary tests,health system (public/private/both), availability of severe asthma units, andgeographic location (cities with high COVID-19 prevalence vs. other cities withlow prevalence). Differences were analyzed using contingency tables and Pearson'schi-squared test. Results: We obtained 95 responses, mostly from cities with ahigh disease prevalence (39; 52%). Only 29 (38.6%) of respondents provided carein a severe asthma unit. Severe asthmatic children were followed up mainly bytelephone (68; 90.7%) and by in-person visits (32; 42.7%). Face-to-face care was less frequent in cities with a high prevalence of COVID-19 when compared withsmaller cities (P = 0.044). Some of the surveyed physicians had discontinuedpatient follow-up as they were caring for patients with COVID-19 (7; 9.3%). Ofall specialists surveyed, 45.3% did not evaluate severe asthmatic children withany means of testing. Pulmonary function tests were scarcely implemented. Bloodtests were the most common test performed (45.3%). Specialists working in asevere asthma unit carried out more pulmonary function tests (P = 0.019).Peculiarly, moderate persistent asthmatics underwent more spirometries in cities with a high prevalence rate (P = 0.03). Follow-up of asthmatic children duringthe pandemic was perceived to be reduced or altogether inexistent by 42.7% ofrespondents when compared with a similar season outside of this emergencysituation. Remarkably, the perception that better management of asthma wasdelivered during the pandemic by those working in cities with a high prevalenceof COVID-19 versus other regions. Conclusions: Pediatric asthma control iscrucial to decrease the future risk presented by the condition. New technologies and severe asthma units may become key tools in global health emergencies such asthe COVID-19 pandemic.

LID - 10.1089/ped.2020.1300 [doi]
AB  - The surge in COVID-19 cases during the 2020 Spring led to a nationwide shortageof albuterol inhalers. As a new surge has begun, shortages may make it difficult for patients with obstructive lung disease, including children with asthma, toobtain refills. Since there is no evidence that albuterol relieves symptoms inCOVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms not caused by bronchospasm, it isreasonable for clinicians to not prescribe it for COVID-19 patients unless theyalso have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - The aim of this randomized, controlled trial is to determine whetheranti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin protects against severe COVID-19 in severelyimmunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients. Patients were randomlyassigned to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (COVIG) or intravenousimmunoglobulin without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Severe COVID-19 was observed in twoout of ten (20%) patients treated with COVIG compared to seven out of eight (88%)in the IVIG control group (p = 0.015, Fisher's exact test). COVIG may be avaluable treatment in severely immunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patientsand should be considered when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available. Thetrial was registered at www.trialregister.nl (#NL9436).

AB  - We evaluated the performance of nasal and nasopharyngeal Standard Q COVID-19 Agtests (SD Biosensor) and the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (nasal, Abbott)against the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay during the Omicron (21 M, 21K and21L) wave in South Africa. Overall, all evaluated tests performed well with high level of sensitivity (ranging from 77.78-81.42%) and excellent specificity values(>99%). The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests increased above 90% in sampleswith Ct <20, and all three tests performed best within first week of symptomonset. The Panbio Ag test performed best in the context of Omicron 21Linfections, that were also characterised by significantly lower Ct valuescompared to infections with 21K and 21 M.

AB  - To inform public health policy, it is critical to monitor COVID-19 vaccineeffectiveness (VE), including against acquiring infection. We estimated VE using self-reported vaccination in a retrospective cohort of repeat blood donors whodonated during the first half of 2021, demonstrating a viable approach formonitoring of VE via serological surveillance. Using Poisson regression, weestimated an overall VE of 88.8% (95% CI: 86.2-91.1), adjusted for demographiccovariates and variable baseline risk. Time since first reporting vaccination,age, race-ethnicity, region, and calendar time were statistically significantpredictors of incident infection.

AB  - Several monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (mAbs) have received emergencyauthorization for COVID-19 treatment. However, most of these mAbs are not active against the highly mutated Omicron SARS-CoV-2 subvariants. We have tested apolyclonal approach of equine anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab')2 antibodies that achieved a high level of neutralizing potency against all SARS-CoV-2 VoCs tested includingOmicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12 and BA.4/5. A repertoire of antibodies targetingconserved epitopes in different regions of the spike protein could plausiblyaccount for this remarkable breadth of neutralization. These results warrant the clinical investigation of equine polyclonal F(ab')2 antibodies as a noveltherapeutic strategy against COVID-19.

TI  - Genetically Engineered MRI-Trackable Extracellular Vesicles as SARS-CoV-2Mimetics for Mapping ACE2 Binding In Vivo.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c03119 [doi]
AB  - The elucidation of viral-receptor interactions and an understanding ofvirus-spreading mechanisms are of great importance, particularly in the era of a pandemic. Indeed, advances in computational chemistry, synthetic biology, andprotein engineering have allowed precise prediction and characterization of such interactions. Nevertheless, the hazards of the infectiousness of viruses, theirrapid mutagenesis, and the need to study viral-receptor interactions in a complexin vivo setup call for further developments. Here, we show the development ofbiocompatible genetically engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) that displaythe receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on their surface as coronavirusmimetics (EVs(RBD)). Loading EVs(RBD) with iron oxide nanoparticles makes themMRI-visible and, thus, allows mapping of the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptorsnoninvasively in live subjects. Moreover, we show that EVs(RBD) can be modifiedto display mutants of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, allowing rapid screening ofcurrently raised or predicted variants of the virus. The proposed platform thusshows relevance and cruciality in the examination of quickly evolving pathogenic viruses in an adjustable, fast, and safe manner. Relying on MRI forvisualization, the presented approach could be considered in the future to mapligand-receptor binding events in deep tissues, which are not accessible toluminescence-based imaging.

TI  - Evaluation of a state-wide effort to improve COVID-19 infection control inMassachusetts nursing homes.
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the deadly 2020 SARS-CoV-2 surge in nursing homes (NHs),Massachusetts (MA) initiated a multicomponent infection control intervention tomitigate its spread. METHODS: We aimed to assess the intervention's impact bycomparing the weekly risk of PCR-confirmed infections among MA NH residents tothose in neighboring New England states, all managed similarly by a single NHprovider. We studied 2085 residents in 20 MA NHs and 4493 residents in 45comparator facilities. The intervention included: (1) A 28-item infection controlchecklist of best practices, (2) incentive payments to NHs contingent on scoring >/=24 on the checklist, meeting 6 core competencies, testing residents and staff for SARS-COV-2 RNA, uploading data, and enabling virtual visits; (3) on-site and virtual infection control consultations for deficient facilities; (4) 6 weeklywebinars; (5) continuous communication with the MA Department of Public Health;and (6) access to personal protective equipment, temporary staff, and SARS-CoV-2 testing. Weekly rates of infection were adjusted for county COVID-19 prevalence. RESULTS: The adjusted risk of infection started higher in MA, but declined morerapidly in its NHs compared to similarly managed facilities in other states. The decline in infection risk during the early intervention period was 53% greater inMA than in Comparator States (state-by-time interaction HR = 0.47; 95% CI0.37-0.59). By the late intervention period, the risk of infection continued todecline in both groups, and the change from baseline in MA was marginally greaterthan that in the Comparator States (interaction HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64-1.00).CONCLUSIONS: The MA NH intervention was associated with a more rapid reduction inthe rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to similarly managed NHs inneighboring states. Although several unmeasured factors may have confounded ourresults, implementation of the MA model may help rapidly reduce high rates ofinfection and prevent future COVID-19 surges in NHs.

AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many dashboards have emerged asuseful tools to monitor its evolution, inform the public, and assist governments in decision-making. Here, we present a globally applicable method, integrated in a daily updated dashboard that provides an estimate of the trend in the evolutionof the number of cases and deaths from reported data of more than 200 countriesand territories, as well as 7-d forecasts. One of the significant difficulties inmanaging a quickly propagating epidemic is that the details of the dynamic neededto forecast its evolution are obscured by the delays in the identification ofcases and deaths and by irregular reporting. Our forecasting methodologysubstantially relies on estimating the underlying trend in the observed timeseries using robust seasonal trend decomposition techniques. This allows us toobtain forecasts with simple yet effective extrapolation methods in linear or logscale. We present the results of an assessment of our forecasting methodology anddiscuss its application to the production of global and regional risk maps.

PG  - eabp9770
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abp9770 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) induces strong antibody (Ab) and T cellresponses. Although considered to be localized in the cytosol, we readily detect N on the surface of live cells. N released by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells orN-expressing transfected cells binds to neighboring cells by electrostatichigh-affinity binding to heparan sulfate and heparin, but not other sulfatedglycosaminoglycans. N binds with high affinity to 11 human chemokines, including CXCL12beta, whose chemotaxis of leukocytes is inhibited by N from SARS-CoV-2,SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. Anti-N Abs bound to the surface of N-expressing cellsactivate Fc receptor-expressing cells. Our findings indicate that cell surface N manipulates innate immunity by sequestering chemokines and can be targeted byFc-expressing innate immune cells. This, in combination with its conservedantigenicity among human CoVs, advances its candidacy for vaccines that inducecross-reactive B and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human CoVs,including novel zoonotic strains.

TI  - Benefits of practice ownership among US private practice veterinarians extend to professional quality of life.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.05.0218 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To estimate the effects of practice ownership on wellbeing of USprivate practice veterinarians. Sample: 1,217 practice owners and 1,414 associateveterinarians (ie, nonowners) who participated in the 2021 AVMA Census ofVeterinarians and Practice Owners Survey. Procedures: A professional quality oflife instrument was used to measure compassion satisfaction (CS; a positiveattribute), burnout (BO), and secondary traumatic stress (STS) in practice ownersand nonowners both as scores and as score categories (low, moderate, and high CS,BO, and STS). For hypothesis tests, propensity score matching was used, withowners (n = 595) matched to nonowners (595) on several demographic and employmentfactors. Results: Owners had significantly (P < .001) higher CS scores (mean +/- SE, 34.1 +/- 0.3) and lower BO scores (26.1 +/- 0.3) than nonowners (32.8 +/- 0.3and 26.9 +/- 0.3, respectively), but STS scores were comparable between groups(27.4 +/- 0.3 and 27.5 +/- 0.3; P = .55). The prevalence of low CS scores andhigh BO scores was significantly (P < .001) higher for nonowners versus owners(53.8% vs 42.7% and 51.6% vs 46.4%, respectively). Both owners and nonowners had a high prevalence of high STS scores (81.8% and 83.2%, respectively; P = .53).Clinical Relevance: Results suggested that practice ownership confers a benefitto private practice veterinarians in terms of CS and BO, but not STS. Theprevalence of poor CS, BO, and STS scores was higher than reported previously for2016 to 2018, suggesting an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high prevalence of high STS scores in both groups warrants attention and action to protect thewelfare of the veterinary workforce and support optimal patient care.

PG  - e0271757
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271757 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Understanding parents' and children's mental health issues wouldhelp design population-specific intervention programs. The present study exploredparents' perceived stress and child emotions and behavior during the COVID-19lockdown among Sri Lankan families. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey wasconducted among Sri Lankan parents of children aged 11 to 17 years. Validatedinstruments (Perceived Stress Scale-PSS and Strengths and DifficultiesQuestionnaire-SDQ) evaluated parental stress, child emotions, andhyperactivity/inattention. Multiple linear regression assessed the predictors of mental health issues, including the interaction between age and gender. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-five parents responded to the survey (mothers:76%). One-thirdof parents experienced difficulties with their children during the pandemic.Emotions and hyperactivity-inattention problems measured via the SDQ scale werehigh among 38% of children, while the perceived stress was high in 79.2% ofparents. Overall, child emotions and hyperactivity-inattention increased withdecreasing age, increasing parent stress, having middle-income compared tohigh-income, and having a family member/close relative tested positive forCOVID-19. Hyperactivity-inattention (29.3%) was more than the emotional problems (22%) among children. The emotional problems were reported more with increasingparent stress, while child hyperactivity-inattention alone was reported more withdecreasing age, middle-income compared to high-income families, and increasingparent stress. Also, the interaction effect of age and gender indicated thathigher age was related to greater parent-reported hyperactivity-inattentionproblems in males. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight how the COVID-19 crisisand social isolation have contributed to increased parental stress and childemotional and hyperactivity-inattention problems. In addition to cautioning thehealthcare workers, socio-culturally appropriate preventive and supportive mentalhealth programs may help deal with further waves of COVID-19 or any other adversecircumstances.

PG  - e0272608
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272608 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We describe the rationale for and design of an innovative, nested,tripartite prospective observational cohort study examining whether relativeestrogen insufficiency-induced inflammation amplifies HIV-induced inflammation tocause end organ damage and worsen age-related co-morbidities affecting theneuro-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Brain), skeletal (Bone), andcardiovascular (Heart/vessels) organ systems (BBH Study). METHODS: The BBH parentstudy is the Multicenter AIDS Cohort/Women's Interagency HIV Study CombinedCohort Study (MWCCS) with participants drawn from the Atlanta MWCCS site. BBHwill enroll a single cohort of n = 120 women living with HIV and n = 60HIV-negative women, equally distributed by menopausal status. The innovativemultipart nested study design of BBH, which draws on data collected by the parentstudy, efficiently leverages resources for maximum research impact and requiresextensive oversight and management in addition to careful implementation. Thepresence of strong infrastructure minimized BBH study disruptions due to changes in the parent study and the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: BBH is poised toprovide insight into sex and HIV associations with theneuro-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, skeletal, and cardiovascular systemsdespite several major, unexpected challenges.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270399 [doi]
AB  - We found evidence from two experiments that a simple set of gestural techniquescan improve the experience of online meetings. Video conferencing technology has practical benefits, but psychological costs. It has allowed industry, educationand social interactions to continue in some form during the covid-19 lockdowns.But it has left many users feeling fatigued and socially isolated, perhapsbecause the limitations of video conferencing disrupt users' ability tocoordinate interactions and foster social affiliation. Video Meeting Signals(VMS) is a simple technique that uses gestures to overcome some of theselimitations. First, we carried out a randomised controlled trial with over 100students, in which half underwent a short training session in VMS. Allparticipants rated their subjective experience of two weekly seminars, andtranscripts were objectively coded for the valence of language used. Compared to controls, students with VMS training rated their personal experience, theirfeelings toward their seminar group, and their perceived learning outcomes assignificantly higher. Also, they were more likely to use positive language andless likely to use negative language. A second, larger experiment replicated the first, and added a condition where groups were given a version of the VMStraining but taught to use emoji response buttons rather than gestures to signal the same information. The emoji-trained groups did not experience the sameimprovement as the VMS groups. By exploiting the specific benefits of gesturalcommunication, VMS has great potential to overcome the psychological problems of group video meetings.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a transmitted respiratory disease causedby the infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). Although humankind has experienced several outbreaks of infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic has the highest rate of infection and has hadhigh levels of social and economic repercussions. The current COVID-19 pandemichas highlighted the limitations of existing virological tests, which have failed to be adopted at a rate to properly slow the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Pandemicpreparedness has developed as a focus of many governments around the world in theevent of a future outbreak. Despite the largely widespread availability ofvaccines, the importance of testing has not diminished to monitor the evolutionof the virus and the resulting stages of the pandemic. Therefore, developingdiagnostic technology that serves as a line of defense has become imperative. In particular, that test should satisfy three criteria to be widely adopted:simplicity, economic feasibility, and accessibility. At the heart of it all, itmust enable early diagnosis in the course of infection to reduce spread. However,diagnostic manufacturers need guidance on the optimal characteristics of avirological test to ensure pandemic preparedness and to aid in the effectivetreatment of viral infections. Nanomaterials are a decisive element in developingCOVID-19 diagnostic kits as well as a key contributor to enhance the performance of existing tests. Our objective is to develop a profile of the criteria thatshould be available in a platform as the target product. In this work, virusdetection tests were evaluated from the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic, andthen we generalized the requirements to develop a target product profile for aplatform for virus detection.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital healthcare workers in Western Switzerlandat the end of the second pandemic wave.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001558 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. In early January 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirusdisease 2019) rapidly spread from China and caused a worldwidepandemic.Hypothesis. Healthcare workers represent a high-risk group for acquiringCOVID-19 and for nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Aim. We aimed to investigate over a 1 year period, across twopandemic waves, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in employees at a WesternSwitzerland public hospital.Methodology. A prospective observational SARS-CoV-2seroprevalence study was proposed to all hospital employees who enrolled on avoluntary basis.Results. Out of 594 participants recruited on a voluntary basis, 269 volunteers (45.3 %) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: this seroprevalence wastwice higher than that reported in the local community. Healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly higher oddsratio (OR) of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology [OR 3.19, 95 % confidenceinterval (CI) 2.16-4.74]. Symptoms showing the highest association with apositive serology were anosmia (OR 11.9, 95 % CI 5.58-30.9) and ageusia (OR 10.3,95 % CI 4.8-26.3). A total of 17.1 % (95 % CI 12.2-21.1 %) of SARS-CoV-2seropositive volunteers did not report a suspicion of COVID-19 in their personal history.Conclusion. Overall, we observed that the impact of the second SARS-CoV-2pandemic wave was considerable and significantly affected healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19.

LID - 10.1093/ehjqcco/qcac046 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to compare the outcomes of administration of LMWH and UFH in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematicallysearched several databases and included observational studies or clinical trials that compared the outcomes of administration of LMWH and UFH in hospitalizedCOVID-19 patients. A total of nine studies comprising 9637 patients wereincluded. Metanalysis showed that LMWH administration was associated with a lowerin-hospital mortality, and 28/30-day mortality compared with UFH administration([RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.32-0.61; I2:87.9%] and [RR 0.45; 95%CI 0.24-0.86; I2:78.4%],respectively). Patient with LMWH had shorter duration of hospital and ICU length of stay compared with UFH ([WMD -2.20; 95%CI -3.01 to -1.40; I2:0%] and [WMD-1.41; 95%CI -2.20 to -0.63; I2:0%], respectively). The risk of ICU admission or mechanical ventilation was lower in patients who received LMWH than those whoreceived UFH (RR 0.67; 95%CI 0.55-0.81; I2:67.3%). However, there was nodifference in the incidence of bleeding with LMWH compared with UFH (RR 0.27;95%CI 0.07-1.01; I2:64.6%). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed thatadministration of LMWH was associated with better outcomes compared with UFH inhospitalized COVID-19 patients. Prospective cohorts and RCTs are urgently needed in exploring the definitive effect of LMWH to provide direct high-certaintyevidence. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021271977.

TI  - Inpatient virtual shared medical appointments to improve health literacy,increase patient self-efficacy, and reduce provider burnout in acutecerebrovascular pathology patients and their caregivers: a pilot study.
PG  - E12
LID - 10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS21764 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Admission to the hospital for an acute cerebrovascular condition such as stroke or brain hemorrhage can be a traumatic and disorienting experience for patients and their family members. The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified this experience in addition to exacerbating clinician and resident burnout. Toameliorate some of these concerns, a team of resident and medical studenttrainees implemented a virtual shared medical appointment (vSMA) program forinpatients with acute cerebrovascular disorders and their caregivers. The authorshypothesized that an early intervention in the form of a vSMA improves patientand caregiver health literacy and preparedness while simultaneously educatingclinical trainees on effective communication skills and reducing clinicianburnout. METHODS: Patients and caregivers of admitted patients were identifiedthrough a census of neurosurgery, neurocritical care, and neurology electronicmedical records. A weekly 60-minute secure virtual session consisted ofintroductions and a 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovasculardisease management, followed by participant-guided discussion. Participantscompleted presession and postsession surveys. Through this small feasibilitystudy data were obtained regarding present challenges, both expected andunforeseen. RESULTS: A total of 170 patients were screened, and 13 patients and26 caregivers participated in at least 1 vSMA session. A total of 6 differenthealthcare providers facilitated sessions. The vSMA program receivedoverwhelmingly positive feedback from caregivers. Survey responses demonstratedthat 96.4% of caregivers and 75% of patients were satisfied with the session,96.4% of caregivers and 87.5% of patients would recommend this type ofappointment to a friend or family member, and 88.8% of providers reported feelingvalidated by conducting the session. The participant group had a 20% greaterpercentage of patients discharged home without home needs compared to thenonparticipant group. The primary obstacles encountered included technologicalfrustrations with the consent process and the sessions themselves. CONCLUSIONS:Implementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care center during a pandemic was feasible. Themes caregivers expressed on the postsession survey included betterunderstanding of caring for a stroke patient and coping with the unpredictabilityof a patient's prognosis. The pandemic has precipitated shifts toward telehealth,but this study highlights the importance of avoiding marginalization of elderlyand less technologically inclined populations.

TI  - Challenges and prospects of neurosurgical teleconsultations in a developingcountry: a reality check.
PG  - E5
LID - 10.3171/2022.3.FOCUS2247 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The adoption of telemedicine became a necessity during the COVID-19pandemic because patients found commuting to be difficult owing to travelrestrictions. Initially, audio-based teleconsultations were provided. Later, onthe basis of the feedback of patients and caregivers, the authors started toprovide video-based teleconsultations via WhatsApp. The authors subsequentlysurveyed the patients and caregivers to determine their satisfaction levels with telemedicine services. METHODS: An anonymized telephone survey of patients whohad participated in teleconsultation was conducted with a structuredquestionnaire. The responses were analyzed and their correlations with theperceived benefits and limitations of audio and video teleconsultation weredetermined. RESULTS: Three hundred respondents were included in the first roundof surveys, of whom 250 (83.3%) consented to video teleconsultation. Among therespondents who participated in both audio and video teleconsultations (n = 250),paired analysis showed that video teleconsultation was perceived as better interms of providing easier access to healthcare services (p < 0.001), saving time (p < 0.001), and satisfaction with the way patient needs were conveyed tohealthcare providers (p = 0.023), as well as in terms of adequacy of addressinghealthcare needs (p < 0.001) and consequently providing a higher rate of overall satisfaction (p < 0.001). For both audio and video teleconsultation, overallpatient satisfaction was significantly related to only previous exposure toWhatsApp. However, for video consultation, longer call duration (p = 0.023) wasan important independent factor. Video teleconsultation was preferable toface-to-face consultation irrespective of educational status, but highereducation was associated with preference for video teleconsultation. CONCLUSIONS:Both audio and video teleconsultation are viable cost-effective surrogates forin-person physical neurosurgical consultation. Although audio teleconsultation ismore user-friendly and is not restricted by educational status, videoteleconsultation trumps the former owing to a more efficient and satisfactorydoctor-to-patient interface.

LID - 10.3171/2022.3.FOCUS2242 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite growing evidence on the benefits of outpatient oncologicalneurosurgery (OON), it is only performed in a few specialized centers and thereare no previous descriptions of established OON programs in Europe. Moreover,increasing application of telemedicine strategies, especially after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is drastically changingneurosurgical management, particularly in the case of vulnerable populations suchas neuro-oncological patients. In this context, the authors implemented an OONprogram in their hospital with telematic follow-up. Herein, they describe theprotocol and qualitatively analyze the barriers and facilitators of thedevelopment process. METHODS: An OON program was developed through the following steps: assessment of hospital needs, specific OON training, multidisciplinaryteam organization, and OON protocol design. In addition, the implementation phaseincluded training sessions, a pilot study, and continuous improvement sessions.Finally, barriers and facilitators of the protocol's implementation wereidentified from the feedback of all participants. RESULTS: An OON protocol wassuccessfully designed and implemented for resection or biopsy of supratentoriallesions up to 3 cm in diameter. The protocol included the patient's admission to the day surgery unit, noninvasive anesthetic monitoring, same-day discharge, and admission to the hospital-at-home (HaH) unit for telematic and on-sitepostoperative care. After a pilot study including 10 procedures in 9 patients,the main barriers identified were healthcare provider resistance to change, lack of experience in outpatient neurosurgery, patient reluctance, and limitations in the recruitment of patients. Key facilitators of the process were the patienteducation program, the multidisciplinary team approach, and the HaH-basedtelematic postoperative care. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating an OON program withtelematic follow-up in a European clinical setting is feasible. Nevertheless, it poses several barriers that can be overcome by identifying and maximizing keyfacilitators of the process. Among them, patient education, a multidisciplinaryteam approach, and HaH-based postoperative care were crucial to the success ofthe program. Future studies should investigate the cost-effectiveness oftelemedicine to assess potential cost savings, from reduced travel and waittimes, and the impact on patient satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantlychanged clinical practice across US healthcare. Increased adoption oftelemedicine has emerged as an alternative to in-person contact forpatient-physician interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the impactof telemedicine on workflow and care delivery from January 2019 to December 2021 in a neurosurgical department at a quaternary care center. METHODS: Prospectivelycaptured data on clinic appointment utilization, duration, and outcomes werequeried. Visits were divided into in-person visits and telemedicine appointments,categorized as follow-up visits of previously surgically treated patients,internal consultations, new patient visits, and early postoperative returns aftersurgery. Appointment volume was compared pre- and postpandemic using March 2020as the pandemic onset. Clinical efficiency was measured by time to appointment,rate of on-time appointments, proportion of appointments resulting in surgicalintervention (surgical yield), and patient-reported satisfaction, the lattermeasured as the proportion of patients indicating "high likelihood to recommendpractice." RESULTS: A total of 54,562 visits occurred, most commonly forfollow-up for previously operated patients (51.8%), internal new patientreferrals (24.5%), and external new patient referrals (19.8%). Total visit volumewas stable pre- to postpandemic (1521.3 vs 1512, p = 0.917). However, in-personvisits significantly decreased (1517/month vs 1220/month, p < 0.001), with anadir in April 2020, while telemedicine appointment utilization increasedsignificantly (0.3% vs 19.1% of all visits). Telemedicine utilization remainedstable throughout the 1st calendar year following the pandemic. Telemedicineappointments were associated with shorter time to appointment than in-personvisits both before and after the pandemic onset (0-5 days from appointmentrequest: 60% vs 33% vs 29.8%, p < 0.001). Patients had on-time appointments in87% of telemedicine encounters. Notably, telemedicine appointments resulted insurgery in 31.8% of internal consultations or new patient visits, a significantlylower rate than that for in-person visits (51.8%). After the widespreadintegration of telemedicine, patient satisfaction for all visits was higher than before the pandemic onset (85.9% vs 88.5%, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine use significantly increased following the pandemic onset, compensating forobserved decreases in face-to-face visits. Utilization rates have remainedstable, suggesting effective integration, and delays between referrals andappointments were lower than for in-person visits. Importantly, telemedicineintegration was not associated with a decrease in overall patient satisfaction,although telemedicine appointments had a lower surgical yield. These data suggestthat telemedicine smoothened the impact of the pandemic on clinical workflow and helped to maintain continuity and quality of outpatient care.

TI  - The Impact of COVID-19 on Physician-Scientist Trainees and Faculty in the United States: A National Survey.
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000004802 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Physician-scientists have long been considered an endangered species,and their extended training pathway is vulnerable to disruptions. This studyinvestigated the effects of COVID-19-related challenges on the personal lives,career activities, stress levels, and research productivity ofphysician-scientist trainees and faculty. METHOD: The authors surveyed medicalstudents (MS), graduate students (GS), residents/fellows (R/F), and faculty (F)using a tool distributed to 120 U.S. institutions with MD-PhD programs inApril-June 2020. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to comparedifferences between groups. Machine learning was employed to select variables formultivariate logistic regression analyses aimed at identifying factors associatedwith stress and impaired productivity. RESULTS: The analyses included 1,929respondents (MS: n = 679, 35%; GS: n = 676, 35%; R/F: n = 274, 14%; F: n = 300,16%). All cohorts reported high levels of social isolation, stress from effectsof the pandemic, and negative impacts on productivity. R/F and F respondents weremore likely than MS and GS respondents to report financial difficulties due toCOVID-19. R/F and F respondents with a dual degree expressed more impairedproductivity compared to those without a dual degree. Multivariate regressionanalyses identified impacted research/scholarly activities, financialdifficulties, and social isolation as predictors of stress and impairedproductivity for both MS and GS cohorts. For both R/F and F cohorts, impactedpersonal life and research productivity were associated with stress, whiledual-degree status, impacted research/scholarly activities, and impacted personallife were predictors of impaired productivity. More female than male respondents reported increased demands at home. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey ofphysician-scientist trainees and faculty found a high incidence of stress andimpaired productivity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding thechallenges faced and their consequences may improve efforts to support thephysician-scientist workforce in the post-pandemic period.

TI  - Teledermatology to Facilitate Patient Care Transitions From Inpatient toOutpatient Dermatology: Mixed Methods Evaluation.
PG  - e38792
LID - 10.2196/38792 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both clinicians and patients have increasingly turned to telemedicineto improve care access, even in physical examination-dependent specialties suchas dermatology. However, little is known about whether teledermatology supportseffective and timely transitions from inpatient to outpatient care, which is acommon care coordination gap. OBJECTIVE: Using mixed methods, this study soughtto retrospectively evaluate how teledermatology affected clinic capacity,scheduling efficiency, and timeliness of follow-up care for patientstransitioning from inpatient to outpatient dermatology care. METHODS:Patient-level encounter scheduling data were used to compare the number andproportion of patients who were scheduled and received in-clinic or videodermatology follow-ups within 14 and 90 days after discharge across 3 phases:June to September 2019 (before teledermatology), June to September 2020 (earlyteledermatology), and February to May 2021 (sustained teledermatology). The time from discharge to scheduling and completion of patient follow-up visits for each care modality was also compared. Dermatology clinicians and schedulers were also interviewed between April and May 2021 to assess their perceptions ofteledermatology for postdischarge patients. RESULTS: More patients completedfollow-up within 90 days after discharge during early (n=101) and sustained(n=100) teledermatology use than at baseline (n=74). Thus, the clinic's capacity to provide follow-up to patients transitioning from inpatient increased frombaseline by 36% in the early (101 from 74) and sustained (100 from 74)teledermatology periods. During early teledermatology use, 61.4% (62/101) of the follow-ups were conducted via video. This decreased significantly to 47% (47/100)in the following year, when COVID-19-related restrictions started to lift(P=.04), indicating more targeted but still substantial use. The proportion ofpatients who were followed up within the recommended 14 days after discharge did not differ significantly between video and in-clinic visits during the early(33/62, 53% vs 15/39, 38%; P=.15) or sustained (26/53, 60% vs 28/47, 49%; P=.29) teledermatology periods. Interviewees agreed that teledermatology would continue to be offered. Most considered postdischarge follow-up patients to be idealcandidates for teledermatology as they had undergone a recent in-personassessment and might have difficulty attending in-clinic visits because ofcompeting health priorities. Some reported patients needing technologicalsupport. Ultimately, most agreed that the choice of follow-up care modalityshould be the patient's own. CONCLUSIONS: Teledermatology could be an importanttool for maintaining accessible, flexible, and convenient care for recentlydischarged patients needing follow-up care. Teledermatology increased cliniccapacity, even during the pandemic, although the timeliness of care transitionsdid not improve. Ultimately, the care modality should be determined throughcommunication with patients to incorporate their and their caregivers'preferences.

TI  - Evaluation of a Digital Self-management Platform for Patients With ChronicIllness in Primary Care: Qualitative Study of Stakeholders' Perspectives.
PG  - e38424
LID - 10.2196/38424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Population aging and multimorbidity has led to increasing chroniccare needs associated with new challenges in managing growing costs, risinghealth care professional workloads, and the adoption of rigorous guidelines.These issues could all benefit from greater digitalization and a morepatient-centered approach to chronic care, a situation brought to the fore by theCOVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about real-life use in primary care.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the views, thoughts, usability, andexperiences concerning a recently introduced digital self-care platform forchronic conditions in 3 Dutch primary care practices. METHODS: We conducted anexplorative study combining questionnaires and interviews among patients andgeneral practitioners from 3 general practices that used the digital platform.Questionnaires were sent to patients in each practice to seek the views andexperiences of both patient nonusers (n=20) and patient users (n=58) of theplatform, together with standardized questionnaires about illness perception and quality of life. In addition, patients (n=15) and general practitioners (n=4) whoused the platform took part in semistructured interviews. We transcribedinterviews verbatim and performed qualitative content analysis using a deductive approach. The results of the questionnaires were analyzed with descriptiveanalysis. RESULTS: Among patients who had not actively used the platform but had received an explanation, only 35% (7/20) would recommend its use due to concerns over communication and handling. However, this percentage increased to 76.3%(45/59) among the people who actively used the platform. Interviews with patientsand general practitioners who used the platform uncovered several key benefits,including reduced time requirements, reduced workload, improved care quality, andimproved accessibility due to the greater patient-centeredness and use ofdifferent communication tools. In addition, the self-management tool led togreater patient autonomy and empowerment. Although users considered the platform feasible, usable, and easy to use, some technical issues remained and somepatients expressed concerns about the reduction in human contact and feedback.CONCLUSIONS: The overall experience and usability of the platform was good.Support for the online self-management platform for chronic care increased whenpatients actively used the tool and could experience or identify importantadvantages. However, patients still noted several areas for improvement that needto be tackled in future iterations. To ensure benefit in the wider population, wemust also evaluate this platform in cohorts with lower digital and healthliteracy.

TI  - Remote Moderator and Observer Experiences and Decision-making During UsabilityTesting of a Web-Based Empathy Training Portal: Content Analysis.
PG  - e35319
LID - 10.2196/35319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 restrictions severely curtailed empirical endeavors thatinvolved in-person interaction, such as usability testing sessions for technologydevelopment. Researchers and developers found themselves using web-basedmoderation for usability testing. Skilled remote moderators and observers arefundamental in this approach. However, to date, more empirical work is neededthat captures the perceptions and support needs of moderators and observers intesting situations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to identify remotemoderator and observer participant experiences and their use of certain tools to capture feedback of users as they interact with the web browser application.METHODS: This research is part of a broader study on an educational web browserapplication for nursing students to learn perspective taking and enhance theirperceptual understanding of a dialogue partner's thoughts and feelings. Thebroader study used a quantitative and think-aloud qualitative problem-discoveryusability study design. This case study explored written accounts of the remotemoderator and observer participants regarding their roles, experiences, andreactions to the testing protocol and their suggestions for improved techniquesand strategies for conducting remote usability testing. Content analysis was usedto analyze participants' experiences in the usability testing sessions. RESULTS: We collected data from 1 remote moderator and 2 remote observers. Five themeswere identified: dealing with personal stressors, dealing with user anxiety,maintaining social presence, ethical response to the study protocol, andcommunication during sessions. The participants offered recommendations for thedesign of future remote testing activities as well as evidence-informed training materials for usability project personnel. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findingscontribute to a growing body of endeavors to understand human-computerinteraction and its impact on remote moderator and observer roles. As technology rapidly advances, more remote usability testing will occur where the knowledgegleaned in this study can have an impact. Recommendations based on moderator and observer participant perspectives identify the need for more evidence-informedtraining materials for their roles that focus on web-based interpersonalcommunication skills, execution of user testing protocols, troubleshootingtechnology and test user issues, proficiency in web conferencing platforms,behavior analysis and feedback technologies, and time management.

AB  - Developing numerous nanotechnological designed tools to monitor the existence of SARS-CoV-2, and modifying its interactions address the global needs for efficientremedies required for the management of COVID-19. Herein, through amultidisciplinary outlook encompassing different fields such as thepathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, analysis of symptoms, and statistics ofneurological complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central andperipheral nervous systems have been testified. The anosmia (51.1%) and ageusia(45.5%) are reported the most frequent neurological manifestation.Cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy were mainly related to severe clinicalcases. In addition, we focus especially on the various concerned physiologicalroutes, including BBB dysfunction, which transpired due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, direct and indirect effects of the virus on the brain, and also, the plausiblemechanisms of viral entry to the nerve system. We also outline thecharacterization, and the ongoing pharmaceutical applications of quantum dots as smart nanocarriers crossing the blood-brain barrier and their importance inneurological diseases, mainly SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations Moreover, themarket status, six clinical trials recruiting quantum dots, and the challengeslimiting the clinical application of QDs are highlighted.

TI  - Effectiveness Associated With BNT162b2 Vaccine Against Emergency Department andUrgent Care Encounters for Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Infection AmongAdolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years.
PG  - e2225162
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25162 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Data about the duration of protection of 2 and 3 doses of BNT162b2 inchildren and adolescents are needed to help inform recommendations for boostersin this age group. Objective: To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) anddurability associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against Delta- and Omicron-relatedemergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and to estimate VE associated with 3 doses against these sameoutcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This test-negative case-controlstudy was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, an integratedhealth care system using electronic health records in the US. Participantsincluded Kaiser Permanente Southern California members ages 12 to 17 years withan ED or UC encounter from November 1, 2021, through March 18, 2022, for acuterespiratory infection who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via a reversetransction-polymerase chain reaction test. Analyses were conducted from March 21 to June 22, 2022. Exposures: BNT162b2 vaccination status ascertained fromelectronic health records and state registry data. Main Outcomes and Measures:The main outcome was VE associated with BNT162b2 against ED and UC encountersrelated to Delta or Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Analyses were conducted among 3168 adolescents, including 1004 with ED visits and 2164 with UC visits. Median (IQR) age was 15 (13-16) years, and 1461 (46.1%) were boys. Inadjusted analyses, VE associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against ED or UCencounters was highest within the first 2 months for both Delta (89% [95% CI, 69%to 96%]) and Omicron (73% [95% CI, 54% to 84%]) variants but waned to 49% (95%CI, 27% to 65%) for the Delta variant and 16% (95% CI, -7% to 34%) for theOmicron variant at 6 months and beyond. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associatedwith improved protection against the Omicron variant (87% [95% CI, 72% to 94%])after a median (IQR) of 19 (9-32) days after dose 3. Conclusions and Relevance:These findings suggest that 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine wereassociated with high levels of protection against ED and UC encounters related tothe Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the first few months aftervaccination. However, effectiveness waned over time, especially against Omicron. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associated with improved protection against Omicron beyond that seen initially after 2 doses, underscoring the importance of boostersfor adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.

PG  - e2227437
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.27437 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Children aged 6 months through 4 years have become eligible forCOVID-19 vaccination, but little is known about parental intentions regarding,concerns about, or facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination for this age group.Objectives: To evaluate parental intentions, concerns, and facilitators forCOVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months through 4 years and to helpinform the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices' deliberations and recommendations for COVID-19vaccination for children aged 6 months through 4 years. Design, Setting, andParticipants: This cross-sectional study fielded an online survey from February 2to 10, 2022, among a nonprobability sample of US parents of children aged 6months through 4 years who were recruited through Qualtrics using quota-basedsampling for respondent gender, race and ethnicity, and child age group. MainOutcomes and Measures: COVID-19 vaccination intentions, time to COVID-19vaccination, COVID-19 vaccination concerns and facilitators, and trusted COVID-19vaccination locations for children aged 6 months through 4 years. Results: Thefinal weighted sample of 2031 participants (73.5% participation rate) had morerespondents who identified as male (985; weighted percentage, 54.8%) or White(696; weighted percentage, 66.2%), were aged 25 to 49 years (1628; weightedpercentage, 85.6%), had at least a bachelor's degree (711; weighted percentage,40.0%), lived in a metropolitan area (1743; weighted percentage, 82.9%) or theSouth (961; weighted percentage, 43.4%), or received at least 1 dose of aCOVID-19 vaccine (1205; weighted percentage, 59.8%). Half of respondents (645;weighted percentage, 45.6%) indicated that they "definitely" or "probably" willvaccinate their child aged 6 months through 4 years once they became eligible.However, only one-fifth (396; weighted percentage, 19.0%) indicated they wouldget a COVID-19 vaccine for their child in this age group within 3 months of them becoming eligible for vaccination. Vaccine safety and efficacy were parents' top concerns, and receiving more information about safety and efficacy were the topfacilitators to COVID-19 vaccination for this age group. A doctor's office orclinic and local pharmacy were the most trusted COVID-19 vaccination locationsfor this age group. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that only a minority of parents of children in this age group are eager to vaccinate theirchildren within the first few months of eligibility, with widespread concernsabout COVID-19 vaccination for this age group. Thus, considerable efforts toincrease parental COVID-19 vaccine confidence for children aged 6 months through 4 years may be needed to maximize COVID-19 vaccination for this age group in the United States.

AB  - Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is rare, however, severehyperinflammatory condition in children generally weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2infection. A subset of MIS-C patients is presented with severe heart failure. We hereby report 8-year-old girl presenting acute severe left ventricular failure.Various medical treatments including inotropic agents and drugs related toSARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C were applied. However, venoarterial extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) was needed to be performed. Due to unsuccessfulattempts for ECMO weaning, left ventricular assist device was implanted to thepatient with temporary right ventricular support from ECMO.

TI  - Development and Modification of a Culturally Tailored Education Program toPrevent Breast Cancer in Korean Immigrant Women in New York City.
LID - 10.1007/s13187-022-02207-2 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in Korean American (KA) women. Inview of its high prevalence in these women, their low screening rates, and thecultural influence of BC risk factors in their lifestyles, we developed acommunity-based culturally tailored BC prevention program, the Korean BreastCancer Risk Reduction Program (KBCRRP). Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEDE and health belief models, the KBCRRP was developed to achieve four goals: (1) healthyweight, (2) physically active lifestyle, (3) healthy diet, and (4) BC screeningand adherence. KBCRRP combines effective multicomponent strategies for BCscreening and a group-based lifestyle intervention incorporating traditionalKorean health beliefs and is tailored for BC risk reduction. In this paper, weprovide an overview of the program, the process of program development,implementation, and evaluation, and modification during the COVID-19 pandemic.The initial program involved 8 weeks of in-person group education sessions led byinterdisciplinary healthcare professionals and 16 weeks of follow-up involvingsmartphone applications, phone calls, and text messaging from trained lifestylecoaches. Participants received opportunities to obtain free mammography duringthe program. After feasibility testing, the program was modified by incorporatingparticipants' feedback. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided the programusing the Zoom video platform. Participants' recruitment and retention during thepandemic was successful, reflecting the fact that virtual delivery of group-basededucation was a feasible and acceptable alternative to in-person sessions.Collaboration with community organizations serving the target population is thekey to developing and sustaining a successful community-based educationalprogram.

TI  - Social risk factors among individuals with a history of cancer during theCOVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1007/s11764-022-01235-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and its economicconsequences may disproportionately impact cancer survivors and their overallhealth-related quality of life. The objective of this study was to examinewhether cancer survivors experienced higher levels of financial strain or foodinsecurity compared to those without a history of cancer. METHODS: KaiserPermanente Research Bank (KPRB) study participants were invited to complete aseries of electronic surveys starting April 2020 to assess the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic. Participants who completed the initial survey and onefollow-up survey were included. The odds of financial strain and food insecurity in those with and without a history of cancer were estimated using multinomiallogistic regression. RESULTS: Cancer survivors (n = 16,231) had lower odds ofreporting "somewhat hard" (AOR = 0.77) and "very hard" (AOR = 0.67) financialstrain, and food insecurity "sometimes" (AOR = 0.70) and "often" (AOR = 0.55)compared to those with no history of cancer (n = 88,409). Non-Hispanic (NH) Blackand Hispanic cancer survivors had higher odds compared to NH Whites of reporting financial strain and food insecurity. Smokers and those with multiplecomorbidities had higher odds of reporting financial strain and food insecurityamong cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: While cancer survivors overall did notreport greater financial strain or food insecurity than individuals without ahistory of cancer, subsets of cancer survivors are experiencing greater socialrisks during the pandemic and should be prioritized for screening for social riskfactors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Incorporating screening for socialrisk factors into care coordination workflows for subsets of cancer survivorsshould be a priority.

TI  - Epidemiological Comparison of Four COVID-19 Waves in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo, March 2020-January 2022.
LID - 10.1007/s44197-022-00052-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nationwide analyses are required to optimise and tailor activities tocontrol future COVID-19 waves of resurgence continent-wide. We comparedepidemiological and clinical outcomes of the four COVID-19 waves in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: This retrospective descriptiveepidemiological analysis included data from the national line list of confirmedCOVID-19 cases in all provinces for all waves between 9 March 2020 and 2 January 2022. Descriptive statistical measures (frequencies, percentages, case fatalityrates [CFR], test positivity rates [TPR], and characteristics) were comparedusing chi-squared or the Fisher-Irwin test. RESULTS: During the study period,72,108/445,084 (16.2%) tests were positive, with 9,641/56,637 (17.0%),16,643/66,560 (25.0%), 24,172/157,945 (15.3%), and 21,652/163,942 (13.2%) casesduring the first, second, third, and fourth waves, respectively. TPRsignificantly decreased from 17.0% in the first wave to 13.2% in the fourth wave as did infection of frontline health workers (5.2% vs. 0.9%). CFR decreased from 5.1 to 0.9% from the first to fourth wave. No sex- or age-related differences in distributions across different waves were observed. The majority of cases wereasymptomatic in the first (73.1%) and second (86.6%) waves, in contrast to thatin the third (11.1%) and fourth (31.3%) waves. CONCLUSION: Despite fewer reportedcases, the primary waves (first and second) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the DRCwere more severe than the third and fourth waves, with each wave being associatedwith a new SARS-CoV-2 variant. Tailored public health and social measures, andresurgence monitoring are needed to control future waves of COVID-19.

LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-04103-3 [doi]
AB  - In the year 2019-2020, the whole world witnessed the spread of a disease calledCOVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. A number of effective drugs and vaccine has beenformulated to combat this outbreak. For the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs,the main protease (Mpro) is considered a key target as it has rare mutations and plays a crucial role in the replication of the SARS CoV-2. In this study, alibrary of selected lichen compounds was prepared and used for virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using molecular docking, and several hits as potentialinhibitors were identified. Remdesivir was used as a standard inhibitor of Mprofor its comparison with the identified hits. Twenty-six compounds were identifiedas potential hits against Mpro, and these were subjected to in silico ADMETproperty prediction, and the compounds having favorable properties were selected for further analysis. After manual inspection of their interaction with thebinding pocket of Mpro and binding affinity score, four compounds, namely,variolaric acid, cryptostictinolide, gyrophoric acid, and usnic acid, wereselected for molecular dynamics study to evaluate the stability of complex. Themolecular dynamics results indicated that except cryptostictinolide, all thethree compounds made a stable complex with Mpro throughout a 100-ns simulationtime period. Among all, usnic acid seems to be more stable and effective against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In summary, our findings suggest that usnic acid, variolaricacid, and gyrophoric acid have potential to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 Mpro and act as a lead compounds for the development of antiviral drug candidates againstSARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Epidemiology, Clinical Profile, Intensive Care Needs and Outcome in Children withSARS-CoV-2 Infection Admitted to a Tertiary Hospital During the First and Second Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India.
LID - 10.1007/s12098-022-04283-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the epidemiological, clinical profile, intensive careneeds and outcome of children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection during thefirst and second waves of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective studyof all children between 1 mo and 14 y, admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 hospital (DCH) during the first (1st June to 31st December 2020) and second waves (1stMarch to 30th June 2021). RESULTS: Of 217 children, 104 (48%) and 113 (52%) were admitted during the first and second waves respectively. One hundred fifty-two(70%) had incidentally detected SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 65 (30%) hadsymptomatic COVID-19. Comorbidities were noted in 137 (63%) children. Fifty-nine (27%) and 66 (30%) children required high-dependency unit (HDU) and ICU carerespectively. Severity of infection and ICU needs were similar during both waves.High-flow oxygen (n = 5, 2%), noninvasive ventilation [CPAP (n = 34, 16%) andBiPAP (n = 8, 5%)] and invasive ventilation (n = 45, 21%) were respiratorysupport therapies needed. NIV use was more during the second wave (26% vs. 13%; p= 0.02). The median (IQR) length (days) of DCH stay among survivors was longerduring the first wave [8 (6-10) vs. 5.5 (3-8); p = 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity, associated comorbidities, PICU and organ support need and mortalitywere similar in the first and second waves of the pandemic. Children admittedduring the second wave were younger, had higher proportion of NIV use and shorterlength of COVID-19 hospital stay.

LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06307-1 [doi]
AB  - Carotid free-floating thrombus (FFT) is very rarely diagnosed in patients withacute ischemic stroke. It is a real clinical emergency due to the significantrisk of death associated with thromboembolic complications. Herein, we presentthree patients with ischemic stroke caused by carotid FFT after less than 20 daysfrom administration of mRNA vaccine BNT162b1 (Pfizer/BioNTech) for Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To our knowledge, these are the first cases reporting carotid FTT following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

TI  - An overview on in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of lactoferrin: itsefficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
LID - 10.1007/s10534-022-00427-z [doi]
AB  - Beyond the absolute and indisputable relevance and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccines, the rapid transmission, the severity of infection, the absence of theprotection on immunocompromised patients, the propagation of variants, the onset of infection and/or disease in vaccinated subjects and the lack of availabilityof worldwide vaccination require additional antiviral treatments. Since 1987,lactoferrin (Lf) is well-known to possess an antiviral activity related to itsphysico-chemical properties and to its ability to bind to both heparan sulfateproteoglycans (HSPGs) of host cells and/or surface components of viral particles.In the present review, we summarize in vitro and in vivo studies concerning theefficacy of Lf against DNA, RNA, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Recentstudies have revealed that the in vitro antiviral activity of Lf is alsoextendable to SARS-CoV-2. In vivo, Lf oral administration in early stage ofSARS-CoV-2 infection counteracts COVID-19 pathogenesis. In particular, the effectof Lf on SARS-CoV-2 entry, inflammatory homeostasis, iron dysregulation,iron-proteins synthesis, reactive oxygen formation, oxidative stress, gut-lungaxis regulation as well as on RNA negativization, and coagulation/fibrinolysisbalance will be critically reviewed. Moreover, the molecular mechanismsunderneath, including the Lf binding to HSPGs and spike glycoprotein, will bedisclosed and discussed. Taken together, present data not only support theapplication of the oral administration of Lf alone in asymptomatic COVID-19patients or as adjuvant of standard of care practice in symptomatic ones but alsoconstitute the basis for enriching the limited literature on Lf effectiveness forCOVID-19 treatment.

LID - 10.1007/s00005-022-00657-6 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate soluble CD147 levels in COVID-19 and identify whether these areassociated with hyperinflammation and disease severity. One-hundred and nineCOVID-19 patients and 72 healthy blood donors were studied. Levels of CD147,matrix metalloproteases (MMP) and inflammatory markers were measured on hospital arrival, while the need for mechanical ventilation and the occurrence of deathduring hospitalization were recorded. CD147 levels were higher in COVID-19 (1.6, 1.0-2.3 vs 1.3, 1.0-1.6 ng/ml; P = 0.003) than controls. MMP-2 (9.2, 4.5-12.9 vs 4.2, 3.7-4.6 ng/ml; P < 0.001), MMP-3 (1.1, 0.9-1.3 vs 0.9, 0.7-1.0 ng/ml; P <0.001) and MMP-9 (0.9, 0.5-1.2 vs 0.4, 0.2-0.6 ng/ml; P < 0.001) were also higherin COVID-19, while MMP-1 (0.6, 0-1.4 vs 0.6, 0.3-0.7 ng/ml; P = 0.711) was notdifferent. Significant correlations were found between CD147 and MMP-2 (rho =0.34), MMP-3 (rho = 0.21), interleukin 6 (rho = 0.21), and theneutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (rho = 0.26). Furthermore, CD147 levels were higherin patients who required mechanical ventilation (1.8, 1.4-2.4 vs 1.2, 0.8-1.9ng/ml; P < 0.001) and in those who ultimately died (1.9, 1.4-2.7 vs 1.4, 0.9-1.9 ng/ml; P = 0.009). CD147 is elevated in COVID-19 and appears to contribute tohyperinflammation and disease severity.

AB  - PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to describeosteoporosis-related care patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic in Alberta, Canada, relative to the 3-year preceding. METHODS: Arepeated cross-sectional study design encompassing 3-month periods of continuous administrative health data between March 15, 2017, and September 14, 2020,described osteoporosis-related healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) andtreatment patterns. Outcomes included patients with osteoporosis-relatedhealthcare encounters, physician visits, diagnostic and laboratory test volumes, and treatment initiations and disruptions. The percent change between outcomeswas calculated, averaged across the control periods (2017-2019), relative to the COVID-19 periods (2020). RESULTS: Relative to the average control March to Juneperiod, all HCRU declined during the corresponding COVID-19 period. There was areduction of 14% in patients with osteoporosis healthcare encounters, 13% ingeneral practitioner visits, 9% in specialist practitioner visits, 47% in bonemineral density tests, and 13% in vitamin D tests. Treatment initiations declined43%, 26%, and 35% for oral bisphosphonates, intravenous bisphosphonates, anddenosumab, respectively. Slight increases were observed in the proportion ofpatients with treatment disruptions. In the subsequent June to September period, HCRU either returned to or surpassed pre-pandemic levels, when includingtelehealth visits accounting for 33-45% of healthcare encounters during the COVIDperiods. Oral bisphosphonate treatment initiations remained lower thanpre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the COVID-19 pandemicand corresponding public health lockdowns further heightened the "crisis" around the known gap in osteoporosis care and altered the provision of care (e.g., useof telehealth and initiation of treatment). Osteoporosis has a known substantial care and management disparity, which has been classified as a crisis. TheCOVID-19 pandemic created additional burden on osteoporosis patient care withhealthcare encounters, physician visits, diagnostic and laboratory tests, andtreatment initiations all declining during the initial pandemic period, relative to previous years.

AB  - Fragility fractures (i.e., low-energy fractures) account for most fractures amongolder Canadians and are associated with significant increases in morbidity andmortality. Study results suggest that low-energy fracture rates (associated with surgical intervention and outcomes) declined slightly, but largely remainedstable in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION:This study describes rates of low-energy fractures, time-to-surgery,complications, and deaths post-surgery in patients with fractures during thecoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Alberta, Canada, compared to the threeyears prior. METHODS: A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted usingprovincial-level administrative health data. Outcomes were assessed in 3-monthperiods in the 3 years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and in the first two3-month periods after restrictions were implemented. Patterns of fracture- andhospital-related outcomes over the control years (2017-2019) and COVID-19restrictions periods (2020) were calculated. RESULTS: Relative to the averagefrom the control periods, there was a slight decrease in the absolute number oflow-energy fractures (n = 4733 versus n = 4308) during the first COVID-19 period,followed by a slight rise in the second COVID-19 period (n = 4520 versus n =4831). While the absolute number of patients with low-energy fractures receiving surgery within the same episode of care decreased slightly during the COVID-19periods, the proportion receiving surgery and the proportion receiving surgerywithin 24 h of admission remained stable. Across all periods, hip fracturesaccounted for the majority of patients with low-energy fractures receivingsurgery (range: 58.9-64.2%). Patients with complications following surgery andin-hospital deaths following fracture repair decreased slightly during theCOVID-19 periods. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that low-energy fracturerates, associated surgeries, and surgical outcomes declined slightly, but largelyremained stable in the first few months of the pandemic. Further investigation iswarranted to explore patterns during subsequent COVID-19 waves when thehealthcare system experienced severe strain.

TI  - Absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in ex vivo cultured cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-022-05776-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human corneal cells andtissues under standard corneal culture conditions using explants of COVID-19donors and primary cornea-derived epithelial cells. METHODS: Cornea isolated fromdeceased COVID-19 donors was cultured for 4 weeks, and SARS-CoV-2 replication wasmonitored by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, primary corneal epithelial cells from healthy donors were cultured ex vivo and infected with SARS-CoV-2 and humancytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a control. Infection status was assessed by westernblotting and reporter gene expression using green fluorescent protein-expressing viral strains. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression levels in cornea andepithelial cells were assessed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 replication in 10 corneas isolated from deceased COVID-19 patients and culturedfor 4 weeks, indicating absence of infection under natural conditions.Furthermore, high-titer SARS-CoV-2 infection of ex vivo cultured cornea-derivedepithelial cells did not result in productive virus replication. In contrast, thesame cells were highly permissive for HCMV. This phenotype could potentially beexplained by low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcriptional activity in cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cornea andlimbal epithelial cells are refractory to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thiscould be due to the absence of robust receptor expression levels necessary forviral entry. This study adds further evidence to support the very low possibilityof transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected corneal transplant donor to arecipient in corneal organ cultures.

PG  - 331-338
LID - 10.3290/j.ohpd.b3276187 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared the success of dental students with flippedclassroom and traditional classroom learning in the restorative dentistry course for the first time at the Faculty of Dentistry of Reims during the 2019- 2020academic year, influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic, and analysed the correlation with students' feelings. The use of an active learning method can improve successduring final exams and increase the motivation of students. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: The same teacher taught half of the restorative dentistry course in the flipped classroom approach and the other half as traditional classroom. For theflipped classroom, students were required to complete their homework onlinebefore the face-to-face sessions. An exam at the beginning and the end of thesemester was conducted with questions about concepts learned with each learningmethod. Statistical analysis was performed using a t-test at the 0.05significance level. A questionnaire on satisfaction was conducted to determinethe students' opinion on this new learning method in the flipped classroomcompared to the traditional classroom. RESULTS: The flipped classroom learningmethod enabled students to achieve better results on the final exam, with astatistically significant difference compared to traditional classroom learning. Student responses to the satisfaction questionnaire showed an increase inmotivation and interest in the lessons and correspond to the increase in examsuccess. CONCLUSION: The use of the flipped classroom for lower cognitive-levelactivities is more appreciated by students and yields better results thanknowledge acquisition in the traditional classroom.

AB  - Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higherconcentrations of SARS- CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Inthis retrospective study we considered different categories of patients definedas "vulnerable" because affected by other pathologies, such as patients withgenetic and cardiovascular diseases; patients with autoimmune dermatological dis-ease; kidney and lung transplant patients, and pregnant women because theprevalence of Covid-19 infection during pregnancy is not known. This study wasperformed at IRCCS San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, North Italy, a zone consideredat high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic from June to December 2020. None of thepositive screened patients had symptoms of COVID-19 infection at the time ofinclusion in this study.

PG  - 181-189
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women may be at an increased risk of developing severe orcritical disease associated with the Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing severities during pregnancy. Weperformed a prospective study to describe the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection onpregnancy outcomes and on the newborn, depending on the severity of the disease. The antibody response and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S) IgG, IgA andanti-Nu- cleocapsid (NCP) IgG, was investigated. METHODS: A total of 48 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled, and sequential serum samples from 30 of them were collected until one year after infection. Outcomes of pregnan- cyand newborn parameters were evaluated in comparison with 200 uninfected controls.RESULTS: Asymptomatic infection was observed in 31/48 women (64.5%), mildCOVID-19 in 12/48 women (25.0%), while 5/48 women (10.5%) developed pneumonia.Women with pneumonia mount- ed significantly higher levels of anti-S IgG, IgA andanti-NCP IgG between 1 and 3 months after onset of infection compared toasymptomatic women. Anti-S IgG persisted in the majority of women from 6 monthsto at least one year after infection, especially in those with symptomaticinfection and pneumonia, while anti-S IgA and anti-NCP IgG declined earlier.Pregnancy complications and new- born parameters were not significantly differentfrom those observed in uninfected controls. CONCLUSION: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody development and persistence was not impaired in pregnant women, while SARS-CoV-2 infection did not cause major pregnancy or newborn complications in asymptomatic or symptomatic women, nor in women with pneumonia receiving prompt clinical care.

TI  - Construction of SHERLOCK-based sgRNA for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics from Indonesia.
PG  - 173-180
AB  - Handling a pandemic requires high sensitivity, high specificity, simple, fast,and flexible tests. How- ever, conventional test methods (RT-PCR and RapidAntigen) have weaknesses in test efficiency. Specific High sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter un-LOCKing (SHERLOCK), is a new technology that can detect nucleic acidseven with limited sample preparation, but with high sensitivity, high spec-ificity, rapidly, and flexibly. The key to the specificity of the SHERLOCKdiagnostic method is the single guide RNA (sgRNA). The purpose of this study was to analyze the design of the SHERLOCK sgRNA, which has optimum potential to beused as a Cas13a marker to recognize the spike protein gene of the ReceptorBinding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 strain from Indonesia. The method used was anin-silico approach using genomic and proteomic data and molecular docking. Thisstudy used a sample of 37 genomic data representing 86 types of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations in Indonesia. Based on the docking candidate results, sgRNA8has the lowest energy to bind to the viral protospacer target SARS-CoV-2 and ahigh melting point value at 70.3 degrees C, indicating that the sgRNA8 chain isthe optimal candidate for sgRNA.

AB  - Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has emerged as one of the mainstay treatmentoptions for SARS-CoV-2. To improve speed of delivery and decrease bedside nursingneeds, subcutaneous (SC) delivery of mAbs has been explored as an alternative to standard intravenous (IV) administration. To date, data regarding theeffectiveness of SC compared with IV mAb are lacking. This retrospective cohortanalysis conducted between April 2021 and August 2021 compared hospitalizationrates among patients receiving IV versus SC administration ofcasirivimab/imdevimab (Regen-COV) at a single institution in Arkansas.Casirivimab/imdevimab was a promising mAb therapy utilized during the height ofthe Delta variant surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Before resistance developedby the Omicron variant, casirivimab/imdevimab was utilized for outpatienttreatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients at risk of deterioration. Primary outcomes ofthis investigation were the 30-day post-treatment rate of hospitalization andintensive care unit (ICU) care during hospitalization. There was no increasedrisk of hospitalization or ICU care with SC administration compared with IVadministration. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate into variants such as Omicronand develop resistance to existing mAbs, these preliminary findings ofnoninferiority of SC versus IV warrant ongoing investigation into SCadministration of other mAbs.

TI  - [Spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 in Cologne and associatedsocio-economic factors in the period from February 2020 to October 2021].
LID - 10.1007/s00103-022-03573-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Even in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, whichtook a very different course globally, there were indications that socio-economicfactors influenced the dynamics of disease spread, which from the second phase(September 2020) onwards particularly affected people with a lower socio-economicstatus. Such effects can also be seen within a large city. The present studyvisualizes and examines the spatio-temporal spread of all COVID-19 cases reportedin Cologne, Germany (February 2020-October 2021) at district level and theirpossible association with socio-economic factors. METHODS: Pseudonymized data of all COVID-19 cases reported in Cologne were geo-coded and their distribution was mapped in an age-standardized way at district level over four periods andcompared with the distribution of social factors. The possible influence of theselected factors was also examined in a regression analysis in a model with case growth rates. RESULTS: The small-scale local infection process changed during thepandemic. Neighborhoods with weaker socio-economic indices showed higherincidence over a large part of the pandemic course, with a positive correlationbetween poverty risk factors and age-standardized incidence. The strength of thiscorrelation changed over time. CONCLUSION: The timely observation and analysis ofthe local spread dynamics reveals the positive correlation of disadvantagingsocio-economic factors on the incidence rate of COVID-19at the level of a largecity and can help steer local containment measures in a targeted manner.

TI  - Changes in cardiac structure and function from 3 to 12 months afterhospitalization for COVID-19.
LID - 10.1002/clc.23891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac function may be impaired during and early afterhospitalization for COVID-19, but little is known about the progression ofcardiac dysfunction and the association with postacute COVID syndrome (PACS).METHODS: In a multicenter prospective cohort study, patients who had beenhospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled and comprehensive echocardiography wasperformed 3 and 12 months after discharge. Twenty-four-hour electrocardiogram(ECG) was performed at 3 and 12 months in patients with arrhythmias at 3 months. RESULTS: In total, 182 participants attended the 3 and 12 months visits (age 58+/- 14 years, 59% male, body mass index 28.2 +/- 4.2 kg/m(2) ). Of these, 35(20%) had severe COVID-19 (treatment in the intensive care unit) and 74 (52%) hadself-reported dyspnea at 3 months. From 3 to 12 months there were no significant overall changes in any measures of left or right ventricle (LV; RV) structure andfunction (p > .05 for all), including RV strain (from 26.2 +/- 3.9% to 26.5 +/-3.1%, p = .29) and LV global longitudinal strain (from 19.2 +/- 2.3% to 19.3 +/- 2.3%, p = .64). Changes in echocardiographic parameters from 3 to 12 months didnot differ by COVID-19 severity or by the presence of persistent dyspnea (p > .05for all). Among patients with arrhythmia at 3 months, there was no significantchange in arrhythmia burden to 12 months. CONCLUSION: Following COVID-19, cardiacstructure and function remained unchanged from 3 to 12 months after the indexhospitalization, irrespective of COVID-19 severity and presence of persistentdyspnea. These results suggest that progression of cardiac dysfunction afterCOVID-19 is rare and unlikely to play an important role in PACS.

TI  - Multilevel Factors Associated with Obesity among South Korean Adolescents before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.1089/chi.2022.0053 [doi]
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-necessitated lockdowns and schoolclosures have limited social interactions among adolescents, which result inunhealthy behaviors. This study compared the multilevel factors associated withobesity among adolescents in South Korea before and during the pandemic. Method: We applied the social-ecological model and analyzed the 2019 and 2020 Korea YouthRisk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS), including middle and high schoolstudents. We considered factors at the individual, family, and community levelsin the logistic regression. Age and gender-adjusted obesity (body mass index >/= the 95th percentile) was the dependent variable. Result: The prevalence ofobesity slightly increased from 11.31% before the pandemic to 12.48% during it;the odds of obesity were 1.12 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.16) ashigh during the pandemic compared to before it. Several individual factors (e.g.,age, gender, fast-food consumption) and perceived family economic status werecommonly associated with obesity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Physical activity and city type were related to obesity only before the pandemic.Downgraded economic status owing to COVID-19 was adversely related to obesityduring the pandemic. Conclusion: Inclusive multilevel support is needed to combatobesity in adolescence during the pandemic and those economically impactedrequire additional support.

LID - 10.1111/lam.13798 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory infections are the leading causes of mortality and the currentpandemic COVID-19 is one such trauma that imposed catastrophic devastation to thehealth and economy of the world. Unraveling the correlations and interplay of thehuman microbiota in the gut- lung axis would offer incredible solutions to theunderlying mystery of the disease progression. The study compared the microbiota profiles of six samples namely healthy gut, healthy lung, COVID-19 infected gut, COVID-19 infected lungs, Clostridium difficile infected gut and communityacquired pneumonia infected lungs. The metagenome datasets were processed,normalized, classified and the rarefaction curves were plotted. The microbialbiomarkers for COVID-19 infections were identified as the abundance of Candidaand Escherichia in lungs with Ruminococcus in the gut. Candida and Staphylococcuscould play a vital role as putative prognostic biomarkers of community acquiredpneumonia whereas abundance of Faecalibacterium and Clostridium are associatedwith the Clostridium difficile infections in gut. A machine learning randomforest classifier applied to the datasets efficiently classified the biomarkers. The study offers an extensive and incredible understanding of the existence ofgut lung axis during dysbiosis of two anatomically different organs.

TI  - When Pandemic Interferes with Work: Psychological Capital and Mental Health ofSocial Workers during COVID-19.
LID - swac035 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/sw/swac035 [doi]
AB  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not only limited to physical health butalso extends to various aspects of everyday life. The present study proposes thatthe prolonged pandemic can lead to pandemic-work conflict (PWC). The articleexamines how the pandemic interferes with work, the association between PWC andmental health, and the underlying mechanism of this process. A total of 303full-time social workers in Hong Kong responded to measures on PWC, psychologicalcapital (PsyCap), and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data were collectedbetween February and April 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was beginning toworsen; 15.8 percent and 14.9 percent of the participants reported mild to severeanxiety and depression, respectively. Time-based PWC was positively associatedand strain-based PWC was negatively associated with PsyCap, which was in turnnegatively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. PsyCap was asignificant mediator of these relationships. The findings suggest that therelationship between strain-based PWC and psychological distress can be explainedby PsyCap, whereby the depletion of psychological resources may contribute toanxiety and depressive symptoms. Positive psychological resources may be anintervening point for promoting mental health among the social servicesworkforce.

TI  - New-Onset IgA nephropathy Following COVID-19 Vaccination.

LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcac185 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused significant economic and health damage worldwide. Rapid vaccination is one of the key strategies tocurb severe illness and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hundreds of millionsof people worldwide have received various COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNAvaccines, inactivated vaccines, and adenovirus-vectored vaccines, but the sideeffects and efficacy of most vaccines have not been extensively studied.Recently, there have been increasing reports of immunoglobulin A nephropathy(IgAN) after COVID-19 vaccination, however, whether their relationship is causal or coincidental remains to be verified. Here, we summarize the latest clinicalevidence of IgAN diagnosed by renal biopsy associated with the COVID-19 vaccinepublished by July 10, 2022 with the largest sample size, and propose a hypothesisfor the pathogenesis between them. At the same time, the new opportunitypresented by COVID-19 vaccine allows us to explore the mechanism of IgANrecurrence for the first time. Indeed, we recognize that large-scale COVID-19vaccination has enormous benefits in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.The purpose of this review is to help guide the clinical assessment andmanagement of IgA nephropathy post COVID-19 vaccination and to enrich the"multi-hit" theory of IgA nephropathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The assessment of physical function is fundamental in the management of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). We aimed toinvestigate the physical function of patients with IIMs compared with those with non-IIM autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) utilizing Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF) data obtained inthe COVAD study, an international self-reported e-survey assessing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in AIRDs. METHODS: Demographics, AIRD diagnosis, diseaseactivity, and PROMIS PF short form-10a data were extracted from the COVADdatabase. PROMIS PF-10a scores were compared between disease categories andstratified by disease activity. Factors affecting PROMIS PF-10a scores other thandisease activity were identified by multivariable regression analysis in patientswith inactive disease. RESULTS: 1057 IIM patients, 3635 non-IIM AIRD patients,and 3981 healthy controls (HCs) responded to the COVAD e-survey from April toAugust 2021. Using a binomial regression model, the predicted mean of PROMISPF-10a scores was significantly lower in IIM patients compared with non-IIM AIRD patients or HCs (36.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 35.5-37.1] vs 41.3 [95%CI40.2-42.5] vs 46.2 [95%CI 45.8-46.6], P < 0.001), irrespective of diseaseactivity. The independent factors for lower PROMIS PF-10a scores in patients withinactive disease were older age, female, longer disease duration, and a diagnosisof inclusion body myositis or polymyositis. CONCLUSION: Physical function issignificantly impaired in IIMs compared with non-IIM AIRDs or HCs, even inpatients with inactive disease. Our study highlights a critical need for betterstrategies to minimize functional disability in patients with IIMs.

LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keac408 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for adolescentswith juvenile-onset inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) is unknown. Severalstudies suggested attenuated immunogenicity in patients with IRD. This studyevaluated the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventingCOVID-19 infection in adolescents with juvenile-onset IRD compared with controls without immune rheumatic disease. METHODS: We used data from Clalit HealthServices, the largest healthcare organization in Israel, to conduct anobservational cohort study from February to December 2021, involving adolescents 12-18 years-old, diagnosed with IRD. Study outcomes included documented COVID-19 infection in relation to vaccination status and immunomodulatory therapy. Weestimated vaccine effectiveness as one minus the risk ratio. Adolescents without immune rheumatic disease, 12-18 years-old, served as controls. RESULTS: A totalof 1,639 adolescents with IRD (juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupuserythematosus, or familial Mediterranean fever) were included and compared with524 471 adolescents in the same age range. There was no difference in COVID-19infection rates after the second dose of vaccine for those with IRD and controls (2.1% vs 2.1% respectively, p= 0.99). The estimated vaccine effectiveness foradolescents with IRD was 76.3% after the first dose, 94.8% after the second and99.2% after the third dose. CONCLUSION: We found that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccineis effective against COVID-19 infection in adolescents with IRD, similar tocontrols without immune rheumatic disease. Immunomodulatory therapy did notaffect its effectiveness. These results can encourage adolescents with IRD to getvaccinated against COVID-19.

LID - 10.1080/01634372.2022.2107135 [doi]
AB  - While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older people has been recognized,there is limited understanding of its impact on older trans and gender diversepeople who often have different experiences of care and support than the general population. This article examines older trans and gender diverse people'sexperience of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a comparativemixed method survey administered in Australia and the United Kingdom. Using anon-probability sample of 84 participants who were connected to social media and service organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia, we found somecommonalities and differences between experiences in these countries. Someparticipants were isolated, including almost 1 in 5 participants who said thatthey did not have someone they could call upon in an emergency. However,participants had rich networks of friends, partners, and family members.Religious organizations and the community also played an important role. Friends were reported as the main emergency contacts and as the main people to whomsupport is provided. This research supports previous findings that friends oftrans and gender diverse people play an important role in well-being.

LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keac422 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate Covid-19-associated risk of hospitalization and death in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis(PsA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) incomparison with the general population during pandemic's first year and comparetheir overall mortality with 2019. METHODS: Interlinking nation-wide electronicregistries, we recorded confirmed Covid-19-associated infections,hospitalizations and deaths, and all-cause deaths between 1-March-2020 and28-February-2021 in all adults with RA, AS, PsA, SLE, and SSc under treatment (n = 74 970, median age 67.5, 51.2, 58.1, 56.2, 62.2 years, respectively) and inmatched (1:5) on age, sex, and region of domicile random comparators from thegeneral population. Deaths from all causes during 2019 were also recorded.RESULTS: Compared with the general population incidence rates (IR) forCovid-19-associated hospitalization were higher in RA [IR ratio(IRR):1.71(1.50-1.95)], SLE [2.0(1.4-2.7)] and SSc [2.28(1.29-3.90)], whileCovid-19-associated death rates were higher in RA [1.91(1.46-2.49)]. Whenfocusing only on SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, after adjusting for age andgender, the odds ratio for Covid-19 associated death was higher in RA [1.47(1.11-1.94)] and SSc [2.92(1.07-7.99)] compared with the general population. All-cause mortality rate compared with the general population increased in RA during thefirst pandemic year (IRR : 0.71) with reference to 2019 (0.59) and decreased inSSc (IRR : 1.94 vs 4.36). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 may have more severe impact inpatients with systemic rheumatic disease than the general population.Covid-19-related mortality is increased in subgroups of patients with specificrheumatic diseases, underscoring the need for priority vaccination and access to targeted treatments.

AB  - With the success of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials, vaccination programsare being administered for the population with the hopes of herd immunity.However, the success of any vaccination program depends on the percentage ofpeople willing to get vaccination which is influenced by social, economic,demographic, and vaccine-specific factors. Thus, it is important to understandpublic attitudes and perceptions toward vaccination. This study aims to measurepublic attitude toward vaccines and vaccinations before and during the COVID-19pandemic, using public data from Twitter. A total of 880,586 tweets for 57,529unique users were included in the study. Most of the tweets were posted in fivelanguages: French, English, Swedish, Dutch, and Italian. These tweets weredivided into two time periods: before COVID-19 (T1) and during COVID-19 (T2).This study observed the shift in the sentiments of the public attitude towardvaccines before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Both positive and negative shiftsin sentiments were observed for the users of various languages but shifts toward positive sentiments were more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Influenza vaccination coverage among health-care workers during the COVID-19epidemic in 2020/2021 influenza season: Evidence from a web-based survey innorthwestern China.
PG  - 2102354
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2022.2102354 [doi]
AB  - Vaccinating health-care workers against influenza during the COVID-19 pandemiccan effectively prevent and control influenza and reduce COVID-19 strain onhealth systems. This study was conducted to explore influenza vaccinationcoverage and determinants among health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/2021 influenza season in Ningxia. This cross-sectional survey includeddemographic characteristics of health-care workers, influenza vaccination status,reasons for not getting vaccinated, and whether influenza vaccination wasrecommended for others. We found that influenza vaccine rate of health-careworkers was 39.6%. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that health-care workers' vaccination coverage was higher when the individuals were aware of theeffect of the influenza vaccine (OR = 0.624, 95% CI: 0.486-0.802). Health-careworkers who from internal medicine (OR = 1.494, 95% CI: 1.146-1.948), pediatrics (OR = 2.091, 95% CI: 1.476-2.962), and surgery departments (OR = 1.373, 95% CI:1.014-1.859) had a lower coverage than those who worked in vaccination andinfectious disease departments. The main reasons that some stated for not gettingvaccinated were that they felt it was unnecessary (52.22%). Health-care workerswho were vaccinated against influenza were more likely to recommend influenzavaccination to their patients than health-care workers who had not beenvaccinated. The incidence of influenza among health-care workers was higher than that of the general population in Ningxia. Under the policy of voluntary andself-pay influenza vaccination in Ningxia, the coverage rate of influenza vaccineamong health-care workers was far below the vaccination requirements of influenzavaccine in influenza season even during the COVID-19 epidemic.

TI  - Interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a scoping review.
PG  - CD015270
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD015270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID-19, a disease forwhich few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death.Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 may help protect those not yet able toget vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine-resistant mutations of SARS-CoV-2may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID-19 is limited. Differentvaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy isa serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries andposes a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review mapsinterventions aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID-19vaccine hesitancy. OBJECTIVES: To scope the existing research landscape oninterventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to bevaccinated against COVID-19, increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, or decreaseCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressedpopulations and intervention categories. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CochraneCOVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded andEmerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirusdisease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We includedstudies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance thewillingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID-19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs), non-randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs),observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants.Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We did not limitthe scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomesassessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines fordiseases other than COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were analysedaccording to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used aninteractive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mappedthe identified interventions according to pre-specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were:communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions,incentives (both financial and non-financial), interventions to improve access,and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, theaddressed population, and whether the design was randomised-controlled or not.MAIN RESULTS: We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which areongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevantsystematic reviews. For an overview, please seethehttps://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=sharehttps://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=share. Studies with published results Of the 61 studies withpublished results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventionsinvestigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testingcommunication strategies to enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Most studiesassessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studieswere conducted in English-speaking high-income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that wereaddressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at-risk patients, or the generalpopulation. Ongoing studies Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs andsix NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used typesof interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptakeas an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted inEnglish-speaking high-income countries. In contrast to the studies with publishedresults, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populationsrange from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students.Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022. AUTHORS'CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneousinterventions for increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccinehesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives acomprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake andcan be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness ofinterventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. A research gap was shown forstudies conducted in low and middle-income countries and studies investigatingpolicy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressingchildren and adolescents. As COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available,these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research.

PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/13548506.2022.2108088 [doi]
AB  - This paper summarises evidence from a rapid review of international findings onthe effects of cash transfers. The learnings were used to inform the design ofurgent response social protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The summarydemonstrates that in response to widespread disruption, cash transfers have broadbenefits for children, adults, and the wider economy. First, cash grants forchild support have been shown to reduce hunger, increase dietary diversity, andreduce secondary school dropout. Transfers may also reduce child malnutrition.Second, there is some evidence that cash grants could encourage job search andeconomic activity. By contrast, there is little evidence that grants discourageadults from working, or increase spending on temptation goods (alcohol, tobacco).Third, for the wider economy, there is little evidence that grants will increase inflation, while some studies find that transfers create a fiscal multiplier and stimulate the local economy. Finally, we review evidence on design considerationsand find that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) are particularly well suited torapid response when compared to conditional cash transfers (CCTs). Outside crisissettings, there is some evidence that getting recipients to enrol children inschool or attend health check-ups improves these outcomes more than unconditionalgrants. However, the differences are small and the additional costs ofimplementing conditions outweigh these benefits in circumstances where responseis required urgently. Comparing evidence on cash grants and food voucherssuggests both achieve similar improvements in nutrition; however, cash transfers are likely to be more cost-effective for governments, especially where a systemto distribute grants is already set up.

AB  - Climate change and population growth will increase vulnerability to natural andhuman-made disasters or pandemics. Longitudinal research studies may be adverselyimpacted by a lack of access to study resources, inability to travel around theurban environment, reluctance of sample members to attend appointments, samplemembers moving residence and potentially also the destruction of researchfacilities. One of the key advantages of longitudinal research is the ability to assess associations between exposures and outcomes by limiting the influence ofsample selection bias. However, ensuring the validity and reliability of findingsin longitudinal research requires the recruitment and retention of respondentswho are willing and able to be repeatedly assessed over an extended period oftime. This study examined recruitment and retention strategies of 11 longitudinalcohort studies operating during the Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake sequencewhich began in September 2010, including staff perceptions of the majorimpediments to study operations during/after the earthquakes and respondents'barriers to participation. Successful strategies to assist recruitment andretention after a natural disaster are discussed. With the current COVID-19pandemic, longitudinal studies are potentially encountering some of the issueshighlighted in this paper including: closure of facilities, restricted movementof research staff and sample members, and reluctance of sample members to attend appointments. It is possible that suggestions in this paper may be implemented sothat longitudinal studies can protect the operation of their research programmes.

We conducted ascoping review to identify, map, and synthesise studies in LMICs that measuredthe impact of COVID-19 on demand for, provision of, and access to contraceptiveand abortion-related services, and reproductive outcomes of these impacts. Using a pre-established protocol, we searched bibliographic databases (December2019-February 2021) and key grey literature sources (December 2019-April 2021).Of 71 studies included, the majority (61%) were not peer-reviewed, and 42% werebased in Africa, 35% in Asia, 17% were multi-region, and 6% were in Latin Americaand the Caribbean. Most studies were based on data through June 2020. Themagnitude of contraceptive service-related impacts varied widely across 55studies (24 of which also included information on abortion). Nearly all studiesassessing changes over time to contraceptive service provision noted declines of varying magnitude, but severe disruptions were relatively uncommon or of limited duration. Twenty-six studies addressed the impacts of COVID-19 on abortion andpostabortion care (PAC). Overall, studies found increases in demand, reductionsin provision and increases in barriers to accessing these services. The use ofabortion services declined, but the use of PAC was more mixed with some studiesfinding increases compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. The impacts of COVID-19 variedsubstantially, including the country context, health service, and populationstudied. Continued monitoring is needed to assess impacts on these key healthservices, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.

TI  - Residential substance use treatment outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women:Distinct patterns for women enrolled before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12803 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Substance use among pregnant and postpartum women (PPW) is aserious public health concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated substanceuse among the general population including pregnant women, and disruptedoperations for substance use treatment centers. Little is known about theoutcomes of substance use treatment for PPW before and during the COVID-19pandemic. METHOD: Data from a longitudinal program evaluation were analyzed toexamine outcomes among 136 PPW participating in a residential SUD treatmentprogram, and to explore differences in treatment outcomes for women who enrolled in services before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were used totest the significance of change from treatment intake to 6-month post-intake onassessments of substance use, mental health symptoms, and functioning collectedto evaluate the Healthy Families Program (HFP), a comprehensive program for PPWlocated within a gender-specific SUD treatment facility in the United States.RESULTS: Results indicated that from treatment intake to follow-up assessment,clients self-reported statistically significant improvements in familyfunctioning and daily functioning as well as reduced days of substance use.Notably, the rate of treatment intakes declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. In separate analyses by subgroup, mental health indicators showed improvements only for clients engaged in treatment before the COVID-19 pandemic and not for clientsserved during the COVID-19 pandemic, but substance use decreased significantlyfor both pre-pandemic and pandemic enrollees. CONCLUSION: Specialized treatmentconsiderations and implications for PPW are discussed, including a need for addedemphasis on co-occurring mental health symptoms and family system stress during apandemic, and the role of nurses in identifying and addressing these concerns.Additionally, potential relapse prevention efforts during COVID-19 for PPW withsubstance use disorders are examined. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The present researchcontinues to highlight the importance of specialized treatment programming forPPW with SUDs as well as the potential need for additional recovery supportmechanisms to be utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - INDICATORS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THE YOUTH.
PG  - 7-12
AB  - The rate of physical activity among young people worldwide has changed in recent decades. A sharp change in physical activity is observed in young people afterthey finish school and start studying at universities. This study showed the mainpatterns of the physical activity among the medical students in Georgia, as well as the effect of the global events. Incentive and inhibitory factors have alsobeen identified that significantly determine the rate of increase and decrease.The aim of the study was to assess the physical activity rates of students atTbilisi State Medical University. The physical activity level was studied byusing the self-reported assessment by means of the specially developedquestionnaire. The questionnaire was based on literary sources and expertopinion, and tested among peers. 34 questions covered demographic information(8), lifestyle and physical activity (16), exercising (5) and impact of COVID-19 (4). The survey through Google Forms was anonymous. Epidata 3.1 was used for dataentry. The data were analysed in Stata 14.0. Descriptive statistics was used togenerate frequencies, percentages and proportions. Where relevant, the Chi-squaretest was used to determine any statistical significance. Sampling frame consistedof the students of Tbilisi State Medical University. Respondents were chosen bythe cluster random sampling method. Random cluster sampling was used withconfidence interval/margin of error 10 and confidence level 95%. A total of 265students participated in the study (Faculty of Medicine - 63.77%, Faculty ofPublic Health - 35.4%; first-year students - 41.13%, fourth-year students -58.11%). More than 57.4% of the respondents consider themselves physicallypassive. 74.7% of them make less than 10,000 steps per day. 79.5% do not exerciseregularly. Students explain their low level of physical activity by variousreasons, such as COVID-19 pandemic (65.5%), smartphone use (56.6%), lack of free time (79.2%), lack of finances (40.8%) and motivation (54.3%). On the other hand,a relatively small proportion of respondents (30.6%) answered that they arephysically active. They go by foot (26.3%), make 6,000 to 10,000 steps a day(17.4%) and prefer taking stairs (57.5%). They engage in a variety of physicalactivities, such as: sports, football, basketball, gym and home gym, swimming,aqua aerobics, dancing, cycling and walking. This study is the first on thelifestyle and physical activity of young people in Georgia during the CovidPandemic. Trends related to the physical activity of students living in Georgiaare similar in different countries around the world. Young people have commonproblems, obstacles or incentives.

TI  - SLIDE: Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Self-Testing with RT-LAMP in a Mobile Device.
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c01023 [doi]
AB  - Regular, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive self-testing for severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed to quellpandemic propagation. The existing at-home nucleic acid testing (NAT) test hashigh sensitivity and specificity, but it requires users to mail the sample to thecentral lab, which often takes 3-5 days to obtain the results. On the other hand,rapid antigen tests for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen provide a fast sample to answerthe test (15 min). However, the sensitivity of antigen tests is 30 to 40% lowerthan nucleic acid testing, which could miss a significant portion of infectedpatients. Here, we developed a fully integrated SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) device using a self-collectedsaliva sample. This platform can automatically handle the complexity and canperform the functions, including (1) virus particles' thermal lysis preparation, (2) sample dispensing, (3) target sequence RT-LAMP amplification, (4) real-timedetection, and (5) result report and communication. With a turnaround time ofless than 45 min, our device achieved the limit of detection (LoD) of 5copies/muL of the saliva sample, which is comparable with the LoD (6 copies/muL) using FDA-approved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)assays with the same heat-lysis saliva sample preparation method. With clinicalsamples, our platform showed a good agreement with the results from thegold-standard RT-PCR method. These results show that our platform can performself-administrated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by laypersons with noninvasivesaliva samples. We believe that our self-testing platform will have an ongoingbenefit for COVID-19 control and fighting future pandemics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to investigate the percentage of professionals with an intention toleave Nursing during the COVID-10 pandemic, as well as the factors associatedwith this outcome. METHOD: a cross-sectional study conducted by applyingquestionnaires to 890 Nursing professionals from the municipality of Pelotas(RS). The outcome was identified by means of self-reports obtained from thequestion itself. Relative Risks, as well as their Confidence Intervals (95%),were calculated for the independent variables by means of unadjusted and adjustedPoisson regression. RESULTS: the percentage of professionals who stated theirintention to leave Nursing was 24.6% (n=219). There was a positive associationbetween the outcome and higher schooling levels, negative evaluation ofinstitutional support, moderate or intense overload, and skin lesions. A negativeassociation was also observed between the outcome and individuals aged 51 yearsold or more. CONCLUSION: except for skin lesions, aspects such as lack of supportand overload, although they may have been intensified during the pandemic, do notrepresent a new fact in the health services. In this sense, the associationsfound in the study reflect the need for cross-sectional actions to promoteretention of professionals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to analyze the relationship between the concern and fear of COVID-19with fatalism in the daily work of nurses. METHOD: analytical cross-sectionalstudy carried out with a total of 449 nurses. Data collection was performed usinginstruments validated in Peru. In the analysis, the Shapiro-Wilk test and theSpearman correlation coefficient were used, and two multiple regression modelswere estimated, with variable selection in stages. RESULTS: nurses had a moderatelevel of fatalism and a low level of fear and concern about COVID-19. The firststatistical model, which included sociodemographic variables, explains only 3% ofthe fatalism variance. However, a second model that includes fear and perception explains 33% of it. CONCLUSION: Worry, fear and having been diagnosed withCOVID-19 were predictors of fatalism. It is suggested the implementation ofpsycho-emotional interventions in daily work - aimed at Nursing professionals whopresent high levels of fear or concern - to reduce fatalism and prevent fatalconsequences of the pandemic and promote health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Respiratory Syndromes Surveillance System was created by theBrazilian Ministry of Health in 2000 to monitor influenza in this country. Withthe emergence of the new coronavirus pandemic, it became incorporated into thesurveillance network for influenza and other respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVE: Toanalyze the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the state of Acre through its hierarchical urbannetwork. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, descriptive and ecological study,using a spatiotemporal approach and using secondary data. This study wasconducted in the state of Acre, northern Brazil. METHODS: This study usedsecondary data, and epidemiological weeks and municipalities were taken to be theunits of analysis. Incidence rates and kernel intensities were calculated forfour study periods. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed using scan statisticsto identify clusters of SARS cases and considering the population of eachmunicipality. RESULTS: In general, it could be observed that there were higherkernel rates and intensities in municipalities located in the north and south of this state (i.e. its most populous municipalities). CONCLUSION: Priority areasfor interventions to control transmission of COVID-19 were highlighted, with the aim of reducing the risks of transmission to more distant areas in the urbanhierarchy of the state of Acre.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases amongasthmatics has been reported to be reduced. However, the findings regarding theassociation between asthma and the risk of severe COVID-19 have been divergent.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether asthma is associated with a reduced risk ofdevelopment of severe COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis onCOVID-19 surveillance databases at two tertiary-level hospitals in Sao Paulo,Brazil. METHODS: The medical records of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19between March and August 2020 were reviewed in accordance with the clinical,laboratorial, radiological and epidemiological criteria for COVID-19, and forcomorbidities. RESULTS: Among the adult patients included (> 18 years of age)there were 52 asthmatics and 1,318 non-asthmatics. Their median ages andinterquartile ranges (IQR) were, respectively, 54 (41-69) and 60 (44-72) years.At least one comorbidity was seen in 73% of asthmatics and 56% of thenon-asthmatics. Among the asthmatics, most presented mild asthma (92%) and theprevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was high (27%). Theasthmatics presented an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-19 of 0.89(95% confidence interval, CI 0.5-1.56); and OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.5 -1.68) aftermultivariable adjustment. Age > 60 years, male sex, hypertension, diabetes,cancer and homelessness were covariates associated with increased odds for severeCOVID-19. Kaplan-Meier estimated survival over hospitalization of up to 30 daysdid not differ between the groups (log-rank P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Theassociation between asthma and decreased risk of severe COVID-19 or increasedsurvival was statistically non-significant.

AB  - This study aimed to describe the management and results of the test event forevaluating relaxation of social distancing measures in Santa Catarina, Brazil.This is an experience report that described results of the test event carried outin July 2021 and for which the participants underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction diagnostic testing 72-48 hours before the event and had follow-up for 15days afterwards. The outcomes analyzed were SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 14 daysafter the event and presence of symptoms. Among 313 participants, the mean agewas 45.1 years and 54.3% were female. During follow-up, 7.7% (24) of thecontacted participants reported symptoms compatible with infection, but of the240 who attended post-event testing, none of the results detected the presence ofthe virus. No post-event COVID-19 cases were reported. We suggest that other testevents be carried out to evaluate the recommendations indicated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the Brazilian panorama of the training of nurses during theCOVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: a cross-sectional study, carried out with 335coordinators of undergraduate courses in Nursing and online data collection,between November 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: All Brazilian states wererepresented. Of Higher Education Institutions, 52.5% adopted remote learningwithin 10 days after determining social distancing and 23% after 100 days; 73.4% kept the students in a mandatory curricular internship. Practical classes had areduction in the number of students per group (46.0%). Most faculty and students were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 and showed worsening in mental health.CONCLUSIONS: The study identified heterogeneity in the resumption of activities, through remote teaching, which mostly occurred synchronously. There was aresumption of curricular internships and practical classes in health services,with a limitation on the number of students per field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To build a theoretical model that represents the experience of family caregivers of elderly people during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Qualitativestudy that used the Grounded Theory as a methodology, carried out in Minas GeraisState in August 2020. 16 caregivers were interviewed. RESULTS: Uncomfortableemotions emerged and drove the caregivers' actions to: adopt preventive measures to protect the elderly from contracting the coronavirus; guarantee theirhealthcare; and make them aware of the pandemic. However, when these emotionsmanifested in an exacerbated manner, they needed to be alleviated so that theycould adopt such initiatives. CONCLUSION: The emotions felt by caregivers cancompromise their health and quality of life. Therefore, health professionals needto create strategies to ensure that they are well assisted, enabling care throughtelehealth. Guidance on the pandemic for caregivers could reflect better care forthe elderly people.

PG  - 1095-1099
LID - 10.14744/tjtes.2021.06777 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies amongchildren. In this retrospective clinical study, we attempted to determine theeffects of the COVID-19 pandemic period on hospital admission time and length of hospital stay (LOS) in pediatric appendicitis cases. METHODS: We retrospectively compared pediatric appendectomies from the date of the first reported COVID-19case to June 1, 2020, which is considered as the start of the normalizationprocess, with pre-pandemic pediatric appendectomies of the same number of days interms of age, gender, hospital admission time, LOS, parental educational level,laboratory values, and histopathological findings. RESULTS: There was an average increase of 2 days in the time from the onset of symptoms to hospital admissionin pediatric appen-dicitis patients in the COVID-19 period (p=0.001).Furthermore, C-reactive protein value was statistically significantly higher inthe COVID-19 period (p=0.018). Given the LOS, it was calculated as an average of 5 days in the pre-pandemic period and 4 days in the COVID-19 period, and thisdifference was statistically insignificant (p=0.273). There was no significantdifference between the groups in terms of histopathological findings (p=0.176).The parental educational level had no effect on the admission time. CONCLUSION:The hospital admission time of pediatric appendicitis patients is significantlyprolonged in the COVID-19 pandemic, but this prolongation had nohistopathological effect. During the pandemic, the recovery of patients whorequired urgent treatment during the 'stay-at-home' period was also negativelyaffected. Notwithstanding, we are of the opinion that the absence of an increase in the LOS may be due to the willingness of both families and physicians to keep the LOS as short as possible. Despite the increase in hospital admission time in pediatric appendicitis during the Covid 19 pandemic process, the lack of increasein the rate of complicated appendicitis may be an indicator of the importance of other factors in the development of complicated appendicitis.

LID - 10.1111/1756-185X.14405 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)in patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Iran, where mostpatients receive corticosteroids and are at high risk for COVID-19 infection.METHOD: We collected the demographic, diagnostic, and treatment data of allCOVID-19 patients by the clinical COVID-19 registry system. We recruited 38 RApatients and 2216 non-RA patients from the COVID-19 registry. The primary outcomewas mortality due to COVID-19. We also studied the risk of intensive care unitadmission and intubation in RA patients compared to non-RA patients. We usedmultiple logistic regression analysis to study the association between RA and therisk of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULT: We recruited 38 RA patients and 2216 non-RApatients from the COVID-19 registry. The RA patients had a higher mean age (59.9 years) than the non-RA patients (57.7 years). The group of RA patients had alarger proportion of women (76.3%) than the non-RA patients (40.8%). The deathrate due to COVID-19 was significantly higher in RA patients than non-RA patients(odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-5.81). The OR washigher among those who received prednisolone than among those who did not (OR =3.59, 95% CI = 1.54-7.81). The odds of intubation were statistically significant among patients who received corticosteroid therapy (OR = 2.58, 95% CI =1.07-6.18). CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 outcomes was higher in RA patientsthan non-RA patients, especially for RA patients who received a low dose ofprednisolone. The results of this study can be used to triage RA patients who getinfected by COVID-19. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required tomore precisely define the high-risk groups.

AB  - AIM: Temporary lodging facilities which were non-medical facilities wereestablished to secure beds for severely and moderately ill patients withCOVID-19, as well as for isolation, non-contact observation, and care of mildlyill and asymptomatic patients in Japan. This study aims to understand nursingmanagement practices adopted in these facilities by examining cases of theirestablishment and operation. METHODS: A multiple-case study design was used.Interviews for qualitative data collection were conducted from August to October 2020. After analyzing the nursing management practices in four temporary lodging facilities, common points were collated and integrated. RESULTS: For theestablishment and operation of temporary lodging facilities, a three-layerstructure based on disaster management methods was adopted: headquarters at thehelm as overseers, field supervisors in the middle, and frontline nursing staffat the base. The structure had clear roles, facilitated information exchange, andprovided efficient and effective nursing care. Field supervisors mainly provided psychological and clinical support for staff and served as information andinterprofessional hubs. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that temporary lodgingfacilities should be organized based on principles of the division of labor. The workforce should comprise nursing staff, and experienced nursing professionalsshould be recruited to the higher echelons.

TI  - The prevalence of positive patients to COVID-19 rapid nasopharyngeal antigentesting in private dental practices.
PG  - 206-211
LID - 10.23736/S2724-6329.22.04627-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A quick diagnosis is crucial in effectively limiting the spread ofSARS-CoV-2. The study aims to assess the prevalence of positive rapid tests inprivate dental practices. METHODS: This is an observational study. 532 COVID-19rapid nasopharyngeal antigen tests were carried out in the Veneto region ofItaly. Patients of 4 dental practices in different cities (Caorle, Montebelluna, Treviso and Vicenza) were screened with a rapid test (Rapid Test COVID-19 Agimmunochromatographic assay, Techno Genetics) throughout November and December2020. All the positive results from rapid tests were further investigated with a molecular test (PCR). All the patients tested showed no symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and had already undergone triage and temperaturemeasurement. In total 532 tests were taken: 202 in Caorle (Venice), 130 inMontebelluna (Treviso), 100 in Treviso, and 100 in Vicenza. Statistical analysis was carried with the computing environment R version 3.2.1 (R Foundation forStatistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). In particular, R was used for estimatingthe P value of the chi(2) test. The test was considered significant if the Pvalue was lower or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of the rapid tests thatresulted positive was 7.14% (38 out of 532 in total, 22 out of 202 in Caorle, 6out of 130 in Montebelluna, 4 out of 100 in Treviso and 6 out of 100 in Vicenza).Among these patients, 36 tested positive also with a molecular test (94.74%), in particular, 21 in Caorle, 5 in Montebelluna, 4 in Treviso, and 6 in Vicenza.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of positive patients screened with a rapid test inprivate dental practices stands at 7.14% and it was confirmed in most of thepatients with molecular tests. Therefore, in high-risk environments like dentalpractices, it is imperative to follow all the precautionary measures, and having every patient tested with a rapid test could be taken into consideration to limitthe spread of COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics and Pregnancy-Related Outcomes of Pregnant WomenHospitalized with COVID-19 During the Delta Wave: A Single-Center ObservationalStudy.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2022.0072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy is associatedwith increased disease severity and an increased risk of perinatal complications.However, few studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 have been conducted inKorea. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical course andpregnancy outcomes of pregnant women admitted to our hospital with COVID-19according to the severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort studyincluded women aged 18 years of age or older who were hospitalized in the Gachon University Gil Medical Center with COVID-19 during pregnancy between July 1, 2021and January 31, 2022. COVID-19 severity was classified according to the "Criteriafor severity classification by symptoms of COVID-19" presented by the KoreaDisease Control and Prevention Agency. Severe cases were defined as those whorequired oxygen treatment administered via a high-flow nasal cannula or invasive mechanical ventilation or should be applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: A total of 103 pregnant women were hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period. Their mean age was33 (+/- 4.14) years, and 4 (3.9%) had been vaccinated against COVID-19. At thetime of diagnosis of COVID-19, 3 (2.9%), 33 (32.0%), and 67 (65.1%) patients werein the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. The most common symptomswere cough (99 patients, 96.1%) and fever (85 patients, 82.5%). There was 1(1.0%) asymptomatic patient. Forty patients (38.8%) required supplemental oxygen and 19 patients (18.4%) had severe disease. Of the 19 severe cases, 7 were in the2nd trimester and 12 were in the 3rd trimester. Forty-one (39.8%) patientsdelivered, including two twin deliveries. Of the 41 cases of delivery, 14 werepremature, 4 out of 21 (19.0%) in mild, 4 out of 12 (25.0%) in moderate, and 6out of 8 (75.0%) in severe. Severe disease was associated with an increased rate of preterm birth (P = 0.012). Four of the 43 neonates (9.1%) received oxygentreatment. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with COVID-19 had a high rate of severedisease and a high preterm delivery rate, especially among those with severedisease.

TI  - A Transient Effect of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in a Patient with SevereCovonavirus Disease 2019: A Case Report.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2020.0089 [doi]
AB  - A 65-year-old male patient with an end-stage renal disease was diagnosed withcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by reverse transcription polymerase chainreaction. The patient complained of cough, sputum, and respiratory distress that worsened three days ago. The patient required mechanical ventilation andextracorporeal mentrane oxygenation. On day 9, convalescent plasma collected froma 34-year old man who recovered from COVID-19 45 days ago was administered. Thepatient showed immediate clinical improvement. However, on day 14, the patient's clinical course worsened again. On day 19 and day 24, vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faecium bacteremia and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureuspneumonia were found. After long-term supportive care, he slowly recovered. Hewas discharged on day 91 without any oxygen requirement. This case reportsuggests that convalescent plasma therapy might just provide a short-term relief and that persistent effort for critical care is necessary to save patients fromsevere COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze in-hospital perioperative complications in COVID-19patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed medical records of 1.250 patientswith COVID-19 for the period from April 2020 to December 2021. Mean age ofpatients was 62.8+/-2.1 years, length of hospital-stay - 44.3+/-3.7 days. Allpatients received therapy in accordance with the national guidelines onprevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection (COVID-19)>>(versions 1-12). Visualization of hematomas, arterial and venous thrombosis wasperformed using ultrasound, CT and CT angiography. RESULTS: Mortality rate was1.5%. Surgical complications included various hematomas, arterial and venousthrombosis of great vessels. Hematomas were detected in 15 (1.2%) patients, 2 of them died. There were hematomas of extremities in 5 cases, retroperitoneal space - 4, soft tissues of the body - 4, internal organs (spleen) -2 patients. Thevolume of hematoma was up to 100 ml in 6 patients, 100-500 ml in 5 patients,500-1000 ml in 3 patietns, more than 1000 ml in 1 patient. Hematomas occurred in 23.1+/-1.1 days after laboratory verification of COVID-19. Four (26.7%) patients underwent emergency surgery. Conservative therapy was followed by lysis ofhematoma after 25.1+/-2.7 days. Venous thrombosis without signs of flotationoccurred in 20 (1.6%) patients, arterial thrombosis - in 3 (0.24%) patients (2ones required surgery). CONCLUSION: Management of COVID-19 patients with various hematomas should be as conservative as possible. Arterial thrombosis andextensive spleen hematomas requiring surgical treatment are features of COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze treatment outcomes in patients with severe pseudomembranouscolitis and previous coronavirus infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Weretrospectively analyzed treatment outcomes, clinical, laboratory andhistological data in convalescents of COVID-19 who admitted to the department of coloproctology for moderate-to-severe pseudomembranous colitis confirmed byendoscopic examination between 2020 and 2021. RESULTS: There were 13 patientswith moderate pseudomembranous colitis and 6 ones with severe pseudomembranouscolitis. Mean period after recovery from coronavirus infection was 19 days.Endoscopy revealed whitish-yellow or gray raised plaques on colonic mucosa in allcases. Four patients with signs of peritonitis underwent emergency surgery. Threepatients had perforation of caecum; one patient had perforation of sigmoid colon and widespread peritonitis. Two patients underwent urgent surgery for progressivetoxic megacolon and ineffective therapy. Subtotal colectomy and ileostomy wereperformed in all cases. Histological examination revealed necrosis of not onlysuperficial layer of colon mucosa typical for clostridial colitis, but also theentire thickness of mucosa, as well as submucosal and partially muscular layersin some cases. Mucosal crypt atrophy, fibrinoid effusion in muscular layer,diffuse polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and necrosis of muscular andsubmucosal nerve plexuses, as well as necrosis of vascular walls with deposition of hyaline-like structures characterize microcirculatory ischemic processes inthe colon wall. CONCLUSION: Severe pseudomembranous colitis associated withCOVID-19 may not be associated with clostridial infection. Further analysis ofpossible ischemic etiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal lesions inCOVID-19 is needed for preventive and therapeutic measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) secondary to vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia is an extremely rare side effect of adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines. CVST incidence associated with COVID-19 itself has not beenwidely reported. We report the incidence of CVST in patients hospitalized withCOVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzedde-identified electronic medical records of a retrospective cohort of patientsadmitted with COVID-19 to >200 hospitals between March 2020 and March 2021. Weused International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes and naturallanguage processing extracts to identify patients with a new CVST diagnosisduring COVID-19 hospitalization. The primary outcome was CVST incidence inhospitalized, COVID-19-positive patients. Secondary outcomes included CVSTincidence and mortality. Incidence rates were calculated using theDerSimonian-Laird estimator method. RESULTS: Ninety-one thousand seven hundredtwenty-seven patients were evaluated; 22 had new CVST diagnoses by electronicmedical record review. CVST incidence in the hospitalized COVID-19 cohort was 231per 1 000 000 person-years (95% CI, 152.1-350.8). Females<50 had the highestincidence overall (males <50: 378.4 [142-1008.2]; females<50: 796.5[428.6-1480.4]). In patients >/=50 years old, males had a higher estimated CVSTincidence (males>/=50: 130.5 [54.3-313.6]; females>/=50: 88.8 [28.6-275.2]).Older patients (45.5% of patients >/=50 versus 0% of <50 years of age, P=0.012)and males (44.4% of males versus 7.7% of females, P=0.023) were more likely todie in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: CVST incidence in COVID-19-positive hospitalizedpatients is high. Advanced age and male gender were associated with likelihood ofdeath in hospital; further studies are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - This paper reports a presumptive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cat. A cat with respiratory disease living with threeindividuals with coronavirus disease 2019 showed bilateral ground-glass opacitiesin the lung on X-ray and computed tomography. The clinical swabs were negativefor SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but the serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Interstitial pneumonia and prominent type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia were noted on histopathology. Respiratory tissues were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen, but the cat was positive for feline parvovirus DNA. In conclusion, therespiratory disease and associated pathology in this cat could have been due toexposure to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - In 2020 the Centers for Disease Control provided the public with recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 by wearing a mask in the community. In the currentstudy, experimenters coached group home staff via telehealth to implementsynchronous schedules of reinforcement to increase mask wearing for 5 adults withintellectual and developmental disabilities. Results showed the interventioneffectively increased mask wearing for all participants for up to 30 min.Additionally, some participants for whom we assessed generalization of maskwearing demonstrated generalization to various community environments.Furthermore, procedural integrity data suggested staff could be coached viatelehealth to implement the intervention, and staff surveys suggested theprocedures and coaching were socially valid.

TI  - Chest multidetector computed tomography imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia patientswith hematologic malignancies.
LID - 10.5045/br.2022.2022085 [doi]
AB  - Background: Data on the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)and the epidemiology and outcomes of hematological malignancies are limited.Hence, the present study aimed to assess the imaging findings using chestmultidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with hematologicmalignancies who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective study included two groups, the first group consisted of COVID-19 infected patients withhematologic malignancies (100 patients), while the second group consisted ofCOVID-19 infected patients without hematologic malignancies or othercomorbidities (100 patients). The hematological malignancies included in thisstudy were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (40 patients), acute myeloid leukemia (25patients), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (15 patients), multiple myeloma (10patients), Hodgkin's lymphoma (8 patients), and myelodysplastic syndrome (2patients). Chest multidetector CT imaging was performed in all patients to assessfor ground-glass opacity, consolidation, pleural effusion, and airwayabnormalities. Results: More than one CT finding was reported in each patient. Nosignificant difference was observed in the ground-glass opacities (P=0.0594),nodule formation (P=0.2278), or airway thickening/dilatation (P=0.0566) betweenthe two groups; meanwhile, a significant difference was observed in the degree ofconsolidation, the number of lobes affected, and pleural effusion (P=0.0001) aswell as in the total lung severity (P=0.0001); minimal, mild, and severeaffection rates; and (P=0.0047) moderate affection rates. Conclusion: Early andreliable diagnosis of lung disease in COVID-19-infected patients may be achieved through multidetector CT imaging. Patients with hematological malignancies aremore likely to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and radiologists should recognize the CT characteristics of this infection.

TI  - Patients' and caregivers' experiences of hospitalization under COVID-19visitation restrictions.
LID - 10.1002/jhm.12924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals did not allow caregivervisitation. Little is known about how caregivers' absence affected patients'care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe visitation restrictions' impact on patients and their caregivers experiences. DESIGN: We used a sequentialexplanatory mixed-methods study design. First, we randomly selected 200 adultpatients with cancer or heart failure hospitalized before (n = 100) and duringvisitor restrictions (n = 100) and abstracted data from the electronic medicalrecord on communication between medical teams and caregivers and the topicsdiscussed. Results from the quantitative analysis guided our thematic analysis ofsemi-structured interviews conducted with a subsample of patients hospitalizedduring visitor restrictions and their caregivers to understand the impact ofvisitor restrictions on their experiences. RESULTS: Compared to prerestrictions, caregivers under visitation restrictions communicated less frequently with themedical team (29% vs. 37% of hospitalized days; p = .04), fewer receiveddischarge counseling (37% vs. 52%; p = .04), and disproportionately more had nocontact with the medical team (36% vs. 17%; p < .01). Video conferencing wasdocumented for caregivers of only five patients. Qualitative analysis revealedthat both caregivers and patients experienced emotional distress, increasedconflict, and decreased perception of quality of care because of visitationrestrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital visitor restrictions significantly reducedcaregivers' communication with patients' medical team, causing caregivers andpatients emotional distress. Protocols that facilitate communication betweencaregivers and care teams may benefit caregivers who cannot be physically presentat care facilities, including distance caregivers.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 evolution and patient immunological history shape the breadth andpotency of antibody-mediated immunity.
LID - jiac332 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac332 [doi]
AB  - Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinctSARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/orvaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediatedresponse is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responsesagainst SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha, SARS-CoV-2delta and SARS-CoV-2omicronpseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories,including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha orSARS-CoV-2delta, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadthand potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, thevariant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and thatindividuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposureexhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that theinterplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape theantigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with importantimplications for future vaccine design.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the hygiene standards in the context of theCOVID-19-pandemic and their impact on the perioperative incidence of hMPV as wellas the typical symptom burden of hMPV-infected children with congenital heartdefects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2018 and July 2021 all patients of a cardiac paediatric intensive care unit (cPICU) of a German university hospital were included in this retrospective cohort analysis. RESULTS: A total of 589patients with congenital heart disease were included in the analysis. 352patients (148 females and 204 males) were admitted before the introduction ofsocial distancing and face masks between March 2018 and April 15, 2020 (cohortA). 237 patients (118 females and 119 males) were admitted after the introductionbetween April 16 and July 2021 (cohort B). In cohort A, hMPV was detected in 11out of 352 patients (3.1 %) during their stay at cPICU. In cohort B, one patient out of 237 (0.4 %) tested positive for hMPV. Patients who tested positive forhMPV stayed in cPICU for a median of 17.5 days (range, 2 - 45 days). Patientswithout a detected hMPV-infection stayed in the cPICU for a median of 4 days(range, 0.5 - 114 days). 9 out of 12 (75 %) hMPV-positive patients showedatelectasis. CONCLUSION: Peri-operative hMPV infections prolong cPICU stay inpaediatric patients with congenital heart disease. In affected patients,pulmonary impairment with typical symptoms appears. Under certain circumstances, a complication-rich perioperative infection with hMPV could be prevented inpaediatric cardiac high-risk patients by prophylactic hygiene intervention.

AB  - This case involves a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and massive pulmonaryembolism requiring mechanical ventilation. His clinical course was complicated bydelirium likely triggered by his critical illness and failed initial extubation, isolation from family, and escalating fear and desperation. In hopefulpreparation for subsequent successful extubation, a unique approach was taken to decrease the risk of panic, delirium, and decompensation leading to reintubation.As a means of orienting him to his treatment pathway and to provide encouragementfor continued recovery, an impromptu patient-directed checklist was constructed. The recovery checklist, written in simplified language, outlined the stages ofsevere illness that the patient had overcome after his emergent intubation. Thelist also outlined the tasks he needed to complete prior to hospital discharge.Unexpectedly, the checklist received a great deal of engagement from both thepatient and medical team and played an important role in this patient'ssuccessful recovery and rehabilitation.

AB  - Zoonoses represent a global public health threat. Understanding lay perceptionsof risk associated with these diseases can better inform proportionate policyinterventions that mitigate their current and future impacts. While individualzoonoses (e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy) have received scientific andpublic attention, we know little about how multiple zoonotic diseases varyrelative to each other in lay risk perceptions. To this end, we examined publicperceptions of 11 zoonoses across 12 qualitative attributes of risk among the UK public (n = 727, volunteer sample), using an online survey. We found thatattribute ratings were predominantly explained via two basic dimensions of riskrelated to public knowledge and dread. We also show that, despite participantsreporting low familiarity with most of the diseases presented, zoonoses wereperceived as essentially avoidable. These findings imply that infection is viewedas dependent upon actions under personal control which has significantimplications for policy development.

TI  - A Medical Student-Run Telehealth Primary Care Clinic During the COVID-19Pandemic: Maintaining Care for the Underserved.
PG  - 21501319221114831
LID - 10.1177/21501319221114831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this report, we outline our approach to implementing a hybridin-person and virtual clinic model at a student-run free clinic (SRFC) during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) are at anincreased risk for COVID-19 infection and severe clinical outcomes. It is unclearif telehealth is a viable continuity of care enabler for the underserved.METHODS: The Weill Cornell Community Clinic (WCCC) implemented a novel telehealthclinic model to serve uninsured patients in May 2020. A phone survey of wasconducted to assess WCCC patients access to technology needed for telehealthvisits (eg, personal computers, smartphones). Patient no-show rates wereretrospectively assessed for both in-person (pre-pandemic) and hybrid continuity of care models. RESULTS: The phone survey found that 90% of WCCC patients hadaccess to technology needed for telehealth visits. In the 8 months followingimplementation of the hybrid model, telehealth and in-person no-show rates were11% (14/128) and 15% (10/67) respectively; the combined hybrid no-show rate was12% (24/195). For comparison, the in-person 2019 no-show rate was 23% (84/367).This study aligns with previous reports that telehealth improves patientattendance. CONCLUSION: Literature on the transition of SRFCs from in-person totelehealth care delivery models is limited. At the WCCC, the reduction in no-showrates supports the feasibility and benefits of adopting telehealth for thedelivery of care to underserved patient populations. We believe the hybridtelehealth model described here is a viable model for other student run freeclinics to increase access to care in low SES communities.

TI  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceuticals in wastewater treated forbeneficial reuse: Two case studies in central Pennsylvania.
LID - 10.1002/jeq2.20398 [doi]
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance was leveraged as a powerfultool for monitoring community-scale health. Further, the well-known persistenceof some pharmaceuticals through wastewater treatment plants spurred concerns thatincreased usage of pharmaceuticals during the pandemic would increase theconcentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluent. We collected weeklyinfluent and effluent samples from May 2020 through May 2021 from two wastewater treatment plants in central Pennsylvania, the Penn State Water ReclamationFacility and the University Area Joint Authority, that provide effluent forbeneficial reuse, including for irrigation. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 (influent only), two over-the-counter medicines (acetaminophen and naproxen),five antibiotics (ampicillin, doxycycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, andtrimethoprim), two therapeutic agents (remdesivir and dexamethasone), andhydroxychloroquine. While there were no correlations between pharmaceutical andvirus concentration, remdesivir detection occurred when the number ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients increased and dexamethasone detection co-occurred with the presence of COVID-19 patients on ventilators. Additionally, Penn Statedecision-making regarding instruction modes explained the temporal variation ofinfluent pharmaceutical concentrations, with detection occurring primarily whenstudents were on campus. Risk quotients calculated for pharmaceuticals with knownEC50 or LC50 values for fish, daphnia, and algae were generally low in theeffluent; however, some acute risks from sulfamethoxazole and dexamethasone were high when students returned to campus. Remdesivir and dexamethasone persistedthrough the wastewater treatment plants, thereby introducing novelpharmaceuticals directly to soils and surface water. These results highlightconnections between human health and water quality during and further demonstratebroad utility of wastewater surveillance.

AB  - Background: The clinical course, comorbidity, and management of symptoms afterthe acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain controversial.Methods: This was a descriptive case series study, examining the characteristics of patients with longstanding symptoms related to COVID-19 who visited ouroutpatient clinic between 1 June and 31 December 2021. We analyzed patients'background, chief complaints, clinical course after COVID-19 onset, and clinical examination results. Results: A total of 90 patients with a mean age of 39.8years were confirmed as having long COVID. The median time between diagnosis ofCOVID-19 and visiting our clinic was 66.8 days, and 89 patients (98.9%) wereunvaccinated. Depression was the most common comorbidity (nine patients, 10.0%). The most common chief complaint was disturbance of smell and/or taste (35,38.9%), followed by memory disturbance (22, 24.4%) and fatigue (29, 31.1%). Head MRI was performed for 42 (46.7%) patients, and the most common finding wassinusitis (four patients). Olfactory testing was conducted in 25 patients (27.8%)using a T&T olfactometer, and 14 patients (56%) had mild olfactory impairment. Ofthe five odors in the T&T, recognition of beta-phenylethyl alcohol was mostimpaired. Conclusions: This study describes the basic characteristics of longCOVID in Japan. It suggests that long COVID is complex because it results in awide range of symptoms.

TI  - Rapid Onset Functional Tic-Like Disorder Outbreak: A Challenging DifferentialDiagnosis in the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 144-151
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have observed an unexpectedincrease in the number of adolescents and young adults presenting with rapidonset functional tic-like behaviours after being exposed to social media content of others displaying a similar pattern of functional tics. Many of these patientshave been referred to Movement Disorders Clinics with misdiagnoses of late-onset refractory Tourette Syndrome after failing different pharmacological treatmentsfor tics. Tourette Syndrome is a well-known condition with clear clinicaldiagnostic criteria and which presents with the insidious onset of simple motorand phonic tics in a rostro-caudal evolution starting in early childhood.Clinical and demographic aspects can differentiate rapid onset functionaltic-like behaviours from Tourette Syndrome, including the former having abruptand explosive presentation of severe symptoms, later age of onset, female gender predominance, lack of suppressibility, comorbid anxiety and depression, atypical premonitory urge and history of exposure to social media content displayingtic-like behaviours. This new presentation of a functional neurological disorder may be explained in part by the relationship between social media exposure totic-like behaviours, and maladaptive response to anxiety caused by life stressors(e.g. COVID-19 pandemic), especially in young individuals. Rapid onset functionaltic-like behaviours may be considered a spreading neuropsychiatric disorder that is potentially fostered by the psychosocial impact caused by the COVID-19pandemic.

PG  - 121909
LID - 10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121909 [doi]
AB  - We employ a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) in combinationwith an extended joint connectedness approach to study interlinkages between fourmarkets, namely the crude oil, gold, stock, and cryptocurrency markets, bycharacterizing the connectedness of these four markets, from January 1, 2018, to August 1, 2021. Our results demonstrate that health shocks appear to influencethe system-wide dynamic connectedness, which reaches a peak during the COVID-19pandemic. Net total directional connectedness suggests that the gold and stockmarkets consistently appear to be net receivers of spillover shocks. Crude oilappears to be a critical net transmitter of shocks for almost the wholepre-COVID-19 pandemic period, but it turns into an important net receiver during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cryptocurrency market acts as the time-varying netreceiver and net transmitter of our network, and it has the most inconsiderablerole within our studied network. Pairwise connectedness reveals that crude oiland stock are mostly receiving spillover effects from all the other markets,while gold could be either a net transmitter or a net receiver, depending on the types of market considered. Cryptocurrency is a volatile market, and its rolevaries constantly over time.

AB  - China experienced a resurgence of seasonal influenza activity throughout 2021despite intermittent control measures and prolonged international border closure.We show genomic evidence for multiple A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B/Victoriatransmission lineages circulating over 3 years, with the 2021 resurgence mainlydriven by two B/Victoria clades. Phylodynamic analysis revealed unsampledancestry prior to widespread outbreaks in December 2020, showing that influenzalineages can circulate cryptically under non-pharmaceutical interventions enactedagainst COVID-19. Novel haemagglutinin gene mutations and altered age profiles ofinfected individuals were observed, and Jiangxi province was identified as amajor source for nationwide outbreaks. Following major holiday periods,fluctuations in the effective reproduction number were observed, underscoring theimportance of influenza vaccination prior to holiday periods or travel. Extensiveheterogeneity in seasonal influenza circulation patterns in China determined byhistorical strain circulation indicates that a better understanding ofdemographic patterns is needed for improving effective controls.

AB  - Human ACE2 Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the key cellattachment and entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), with the original SARS-CoV-2 isolates unable to use mouse ACE2(mACE2). Herein we describe the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 strain capable ofACE2-independent infection and the evolution of mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro serial passaging of virus in co-cultures of cell lines expressing hACE2 and mACE2. MA viruses evolved with up to five amino acid changes in the spikeprotein, all of which have been seen in human isolates. MA viruses replicated to high titers in C57BL/6J mouse lungs and nasal turbinates and causedcharacteristic lung histopathology. One MA virus also evolved to replicateefficiently in several ACE2-negative cell lines across several species, includingclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associatedprotein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) ACE2 knockout cells. An E484D substitution is likelyinvolved in ACE2-independent entry and has appeared in only approximately 0.003per cent of human isolates globally, suggesting that it provided no significantselection advantage in humans. ACE2-independent entry reveals a SARS-CoV-2infection mechanism that has potential implications for disease pathogenesis,evolution, tropism, and perhaps also intervention development.

Although this video teleconferencing softwarefacilitated communication between students and faculty around the world,technically the blank, silenced log-in screens removed the "connectedness" of theclassroom. A medical educator plays music during the pre-class Zoom synchronoussession as an approach to encourage a positive learning environment in apreclinical science course.

AB  - This study aims to explore the implementation and challenges of China's national online education strategy - "Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning"(SCWSL) - during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of children and theirparents. Altogether 28,334 children (aged 6-8 years) and their parents wererandomly sampled from nine cities in five provinces of China, and a mixed-method design involving a questionnaire and interviews was used. The results indicatedthat: (1) most children had participated in online education characterized bywide-ranging content, teacher-led interaction, and rich learning platforms; (2)online education had a negative impact on children's physical and mental health; (3) parent pressure was at a medium to high level due to online education; and(4) parents perceived that online education was less effective than offlineeducation, and this perception varied significantly between geographical regions,living areas, and school types. These findings reveal that the suddenimplementation of nationwide online education created many challenges, and alsoprovided practical implications for countries carrying out online education inthe post-pandemic era.

TI  - Futures for Post-Pandemic Mathematics Teacher Education: responsiveness andresponsibility in the Face of a Crisis.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s11858-022-01394-y [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruption to mathematics teacher educationworldwide. This paper is anchored in our learnings from the experiences ofteacher educators at four major universities from the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations as they dealt with changes in their programs' delivery triggered bythe pandemic, and raises challenges that remain for the futures of post-pandemic mathematics teacher education. Here, we use the two ethical constructs ofresponsiveness and responsibility to guide actions in response to a crisis, inorder to discuss a range of decisions the participants made to respond to thecrisis. Behind their initial response to the emergent conditions, theparticipants were concerned about maintaining the continuity of their students'education. Further, we identify remaining challenges for mathematics teachereducators to re-imagine their curriculum, teaching, assessment, and equitableaccess towards a more relevant, productive, and equitable mathematics teachereducation. This study adds to the rapidly increasing literature on the effect of the pandemic on mathematics education in the following three ways: (1) here wetake a comprehensive view of the disruptions instigated by the pandemic;, (2) we pay special attention to issues of equity; and (3) we address concerns aboutpossible and desirable post-pandemic futures.

AB  - Objectives: : Through April 2021, sixteen months into the pandemic and fourmonths after availability of COVID-19 vaccines, estimate the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Canada. Methods: : We searched publication databases, preprintservers, public health databases and the grey literature for seroprevalencesurveys conducted in Canada from November 1, 2019, to July 10, 2021. Studies wereassessed for bias using the Joanna Briggs Checklist. Number infections derivedfrom seroprevalence estimates were compared to reported cases to estimateunder-ascertainment ratios. Results: : We identified 12 serosurveys with 210,321 participants. Three (25%) serosurveys were conducted at the national level, 1(8.3%) at the provincial level, and 8 (66.7%) at the local level. All 12serosurveys had moderate or high risk of bias. The proportion infected by April2021 was low (2.6%). The proportion infected were higher in surveys of residents of long-term care facilities (43.0% - 86%), workers at long-term care facilities (22.4%-32.4%), and workers in healthcare institutions (1.4% - 14%). Conclusions: : As of April 2021, the proportion of the Canadians infected by SARS-CoV-2 waslow in the overall population but high in healthcare facilities, particularlylong-term care facilities, supporting the need for vaccines.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune response and produces protectiveantibodies, and these changes may persist after patients discharged fromhospital. Methods: This study conducted a one-year follow-up study on patientswith COVID-19 to observe the dynamic changes of circulating leukocyte subsets andvirus-specific antibodies. Results: A total of 66 patients with COVID-19 and 213 healthy patients with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were included. Thevirus-specific total antibody, IgG and IgM antibody of patients after one year ofrecovery were higher than those of healthy vaccinated participants (94.13 vs4.65, 2.67 vs 0.44, 0.09 vs 0.06, respectively) (P < 0.001). Neutrophil count (OR= 1.73, 95% CI: 1.10-2.70, P = 0.016) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR =1.59, 95% CI: 1.05-2.41, P = 0.030) at discharge were the influencing factors forthe positivity of virus-specific IgG antibody in patients after one year ofrecovery. The counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and NK cells increased with the timeof recovery, and remained basically stable from 9 to 12 months after discharge.After 12 months, the positivity of IgG antibody was 85.3% and IgM was 11.8%,while the virus-specific antibody changed dynamically in patients within one yearafter discharge. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody of recoveredpatients showed dynamic fluctuation after discharge, while the leukocyte subsets gradually increased and basically stabilized after 9 months.

PG  - 2670
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2670 [doi]
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) led to extreme actions being taken by the governments to restrict the spread of this virus.Closure of schools, sport clubs and playgrounds were among these actions;children had to stay indoors and were not allowed to pursue their normallifestyle activities. Objectives: To assess the differences in health-relatedbehaviors among Jordanian school-aged children (6-16 years) before and duringCOVID-19 quarantine and to evaluate public's perception of the role ofpharmacists regarding children's health-related behaviors management. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to January 2021 using ananonymous web-based survey. The survey was developed based on previouslypublished surveys. Evaluation of the validity and reliability of the survey were conducted by a professional committee of clinical pharmacists and a statistician.Results: A total of 230 children, aged 9.02+/- 2.977 participated in the study.Physical activity and healthy balanced meals decreased (less than 1 hr or 1-3hrs/week vs 2 meals/day, p= <0.001), whereas daily screen time (1-3 hrs/week vs4-6 hrs/week, p= <0.001), sleep hours (8-9 hrs/day vs 10-11 hrs/day, p= <0.001)and the ingestion of unhealthy snacks had increased (1-2 meals/day vs. 2-3meals/day, p=<0.001). A positive perception of pharmacists' role during thepandemic was revealed. Conclusion: The present study showed that a significantchange in children's health-related behavior happened during the COVID-19pandemic. Such changes can lead to social, physical and mental health problems.The public perceived community pharmacists as trusted health care professionalsduring the pandemic.

PG  - 2634
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2634 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The study aimed to explore changes in community pharmacies' processes in response to the pandemic in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and factorsaffecting the adoption of these changes. Method: A cross-sectional study wasconducted using a self-administered questionnaire that was distributed tolicensed community pharmacists in the UAE. The survey used to collect informationon the type of telepharmacy services and related topics such as constraints andsupports. The evaluation of services was done for three periods: before, duringand after lockdown. Results: The number of completed surveys was 391. Themajority of the participants were under 35 years old (79.5%), female (65.0%),with a bachelor's degree (82.6%), and working in a pharmacy group (70.6%).Pharmacies provided the services by phone (95.6%) and/or messaging applications(80.0%) such as WhatsApp and Messenger. The community pharmacies provided avariety of services using telepharmacy tools such as managing of mild diseases,dispensing and delivering prescribed and OTC medications, general healthinformation, and services for patients with chronic disease. The main factorsthat had significant effects on several telepharmacy services were pharmacies'type (group/chain vs. individual) and the number of pharmacists in the pharmacy(p < 0.05). Lack of time, training and financial support were the main barriersassociated with telepharmacy services among individual pharmacies. Conclusion:Telepharmacy supported the work of community pharmacies during the COVID-19pandemic by facilitating the provision of pharmaceutical services. Although theoccurrence of several financial and technical problems, it appeared lessfrequently in pharmacy chains with a large number of pharmacists.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the co-infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) amongpatients with asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 in Jordan. Also, to determine the frequency of acute asthma exacerbation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic ona matched basis. Methods: The data of this prospective cohort research consisted of clinical variables. During the first visit, and after 14-days, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed forHRV and SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results: Forty-seven out of 175 (26.9%) COVID-19adult cases have been diagnosed with asthma. The number of asthma exacerbationsamong the study participants was higher during 2021 than in 2020 (p=0.035). Most of the included asthmatic participants (61.7%) were only positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 38.3% were co-infected with HRV. The SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold value waslower in samples infected with both viruses compared to samples infected withSARS-CoV-2 alone, p<0.005. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that HRV andSARS-CoV-2 were significantly more prevalent in asthma exacerbations than stable asthma. Thus, HRV and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections were potentially cofactors orcontributors to the asthma exacerbation in this cohort. This is the first study, in Jordan, to investigate the HRV co-infection in COVID-19 asthmatic patients andHRV could be related with a higher severity of COVID-19.

TI  - What do persons with diabetes want from community pharmacies? A qualitativestudy.
PG  - 2677
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2677 [doi]
AB  - Background: Diabetes is a demanding disease with a complex treatment regimen.Many persons with diabetes have difficulty managing their disease and takingmedication as prescribed, possibly because they lack knowledge and sometimesmisinterpret medical benefits. Community pharmacies continuously provideprofessional counselling to persons with diabetes. Objective: This study aimed toexplore 1) which services adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes want fromcommunity pharmacies and 2) how pharmacies can meet these wishes. Methods: Aqualitative, explorative study design using focus group interviews was chosen.Informants were recruited from Region Zealand in Denmark. Data were digitallyrecorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed by means of thematic analysis.Results: Thirteen adults (11 female) with the mean age of 66.2 years (range 49-81years) participated in one physical (n=6) or one online (n=7) focus groupinterview. Ten had type 2 diabetes, three had type 1 diabetes. The averageduration of participants' diabetes was 13.4 years (range 2.3-33.0 years). Theanalysis revealed three overall themes of the functions which the informantswould like community pharmacies to fulfil: 1) raise awareness of pharmacies'counselling service and competences; 2) act as a dialogue partner; 3) be a sourceof information and guidance about local activities and support. Conclusion: Theinformants did not regard community pharmacies as a natural part of thehealthcare system or as a place where they would expect counselling. They wouldlike the community pharmacy to make their medical competences and servicesobvious and the community pharmacy staff to act as a dialogue partner and providecompetent counselling. The informants would like to have a contact person withdiabetes competences with whom they can book an appointment to complementover-the-counter counselling. They experience a gap in their care between routinevisits in the healthcare system and suggest that community pharmacies counsellingservices become a natural supplement and that healthcare professionals in theprimary and secondary sectors inform patients about the services - especially forpatients newly diagnosed with diabetes. Finally, they would like a formalcollaboration between diabetes associations and community pharmacies to maketheir competences, services and information visible.

LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2652 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of an online tutorial and its impact on improving knowledge and skills of pharmacy students in the clinicalproblem-solving process that is necessary to implement pharmaceutical care.Methods: This is a prospective interventional study conducted during the COVID-19pandemic restrictions using four novel templates. The first two levels ofKirkpatrick's Model (Reaction and Learning) were used. Results: 129 participants completed all of the online training parts. The findings indicated a significant improvement in the students' knowledge and skills. The participants achievedhigher score following the tutorial than the baseline, with a statisticallysignificant difference (p < 0.001). There was a significant improvement in thenumber of detected treatment-related problems. The majority of students weresatisfied with the overall training process and stated a high evaluation scoreout of 10 (mean = 7.93 +/- 1.42, median = 8.00). Conclusion: The educationalintervention achieved a substantial positive impact on decision-making skills of participating students and was considered effective in helping them attain basic skills such as teamwork, peer assessment, communication and critical evaluation. Healthcare providers must work together to ensure accurate medication use during care transitions. Pharmacists, as medication experts, play an important role inthe implementation process. Pharmacy educators must prepare pharmacy student touse pharmaceutical care in their future practice.

LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2678 [doi]
AB  - The vaccine was the only way to fight against Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) from its statement as a pandemic till day. COVID-19 vaccines were approved by the worldhealth organization (WHO) in December 2020. Despite a large number of studiesregarding the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, to our knowledge, therewere limited studies that outlined the gender disparity towards COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects. This study aims to outline the variety of side effects among menand women after getting COVID-19 vaccines (either single or two doses). It is across-sectional study accomplished electronically from September to November2021. The participants involved were 843 Health Care Workers (HCWs) fromdifferent cities in Iraq. The majority of respondents were females (664). Around 65% of males experienced adverse effects compared to 77% of females. A highfrequency of severe pain was reported among females. Regarding dermatologicalreactions like swelling, redness and skin rash were also higher reported amongfemale subjects. In addition to that, higher frequencies of moderate and severesystemic adverse effects and mild to moderate nausea was also reported morefrequently among females. In terms of cardiopulmonary adverse effects, all thereported adverse effects were found more frequently among females. In conclusion,COVID-19 vaccines produced limited adverse effects and the majority of them were reported among women. This may be associated with hormonal and psychologicalfactors related to them.

AB  - Background: Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United ArabEmirates (UAE) government has taken a series of preventive measures to controlthe spread of the Coronavirus. Dealing with the unforeseen challenges caused bythe pandemic has had a profound impact on people all around the world.Pharmacists played an important public health role during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they were the first point of contact with the public and the first source of information, providing accurate and reliable management and preventive measures. The aim of this study was to analyse the distress symptoms and the associatedfactors among a sample of the UAE population. Materials and Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted over the period of September toOctober 2020. A bilingual online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among individuals aged 15 years and above. Data was analyzed using StatisticalPackage for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: Most of the students in the samplefound online learning less effective than in-class learning. Among these, 49.9%and 62.8 % reported that they had normal sleep and eating habits, respectively.In all the sample, most of the participants (96%) were adherent to preventivemeasures. Higher levels of distress during the COVID-19 lockdown were found amongfemales, individuals younger than 35 years old, those who neglected personalhygiene and who had worse quality of family gatherings and relationships.Conclusion: This study identified factors associated with distress symptomsexperienced by people during the lockdown and perceived attitudes regardingonline learning, preventive measures and changes in people's behaviours andfamily environment. Knowledge about how lockdown has affected the lives of thepopulations can be used to design public health interventions aimed at promoting the health and well-being of the communities.

PG  - 101208
LID - 10.1016/j.cobeha.2022.101208 [doi]
AB  - People from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) represent large portions of the world population, often occupy less favorable living conditions, andtypically suffer greater health risks, yet frequently receive little research andglobal health attention. The present study reviews emerging evidence onproblematic use of the internet (PUI) in LMICs prior/during the COVID-19pandemic. Analyzed studies mainly focused on general properties of PUI inuniversity students, problematic gaming in youth, or problematic use of socialmedia in adults, registering higher prevalence estimates, as compared to earlier reports. Research mainly focused on initially affected regions and COVID-exposed populations. Overall, unfavorable circumstances including poor social support,family relationships and lifestyle tendencies/habits may present potential riskfor PUI in LMICs, likely exacerbated during the pandemic.

TI  - Coping strategies of Nigerian medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 15-22
LID - 10.4314/gmj.v56i1.3 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study assessed the coping strategies of Nigerian medical studentsduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: We conducted an online descriptivecross-sectional study among medical and dental students attending three of thelargest Colleges of Medicine in the Southwestern zone of Nigeria. Settings: Ourstudy involved students across the pre-clinical and clinical levels of the three Colleges of Medicine. Participants: We selected the respondents through apurposive sampling technique and disseminated questionnaires applied using anonline survey platform (Google forms https://forms.gle/19yfEzehJKwsme759). Atotal of 1010 participants out of 2404 eligible students completed thequestionnaires accurately, giving a response rate of 42%. Methods: The Brief-COPEquestionnaire assessed the participants' coping strategies (approach andavoidant) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a bivariate analysis usingthe chi-square test and multiple regression analysis (p< 0.05) to determine thepredictors of avoidant coping strategies. Results: Respondents mean age was21.8+/-2.9 years, results were presented as Odds Ratios(OR) at 95% confidenceintervals(CI). About 95% of respondents employed an approach coping strategy,while the minority(5%) adopted an avoidant coping strategy. Females were threetimes more likely to employ an avoidant coping strategy (OR=3.32 (95% CI1.67-6.21) compared to male students. Conclusion: This study reveals that themajority of the respondents employed an approach coping strategy towards theCOVID-19 pandemic. Females were more likely to employ an avoidant copingstrategy. We recommend gender-specific programs to help medical students copewith the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding: No External Funding.

TI  - Risk factors of hikikomori among office workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Aprospective online survey.
PG  - 1-19
LID - 10.1007/s12144-022-03446-8 [doi]
AB  - The global pandemic of COVID-19 has forced people to restrict their outings. InJapan, self-restraint behavior (SRB) has been requested by the government, andsome of those decreasing their outings may shift to pathological socialwithdrawal; hikikomori. The purpose of this study was to examine the risk factorsof hikikomori conducting an online prospective survey. An online survey wasconducted in June 2020 and December 2020; (1) SRB-related indicators (degree ofSRB, motivation for SRB, stigma and self-stigma toward COVID-19, anxiety anddepressive feelings toward COVID-19) and (2) general mental health (hikikomoritendency, depressive symptoms, modern type depression (MTD) tendency, internetaddiction) were collected. A cross-lagged effects model was performed to examine the association between these variables. Lack of emotional support and lack ofsocialization in June 2020 increased isolation in December 2020. Besides, MTD andhikikomori interacted with each other. Interestingly, although hikikomoritendency increased depressive tendencies, SRB itself did not have a significantpath on any mental health-related variables. Poor interpersonal relationships,rather than SRB per se, are suggested to be a risk factor for increased isolationamong office workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate early interventionssuch as interpersonal or emotional support may prevent the transition topathological hikikomori. The association between MTD and hikikomori seems toreveal the interesting possibility that MTD is a gateway to increased risk ofhikikomori, and that hikikomori is a gateway to MTD as well. Future research isrequired to elucidate the relationship between hikikomori and MTD.

LID - 10.1016/j.snb.2022.132445 [doi]
AB  - With the frequent detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) in dwellings and wastewater, the risk of transmission ofenvironmental contaminants is of great concern. Fast, simple and sensitivesensors are essential for timely detecting infection and controlling transmissionthrough environment fomites. Herein, we developed a Surface Enhanced RamanScattering (SERS) aptasensor, which can realize ultrasensitive and rapid assay ofSARS-CoV-2 viral particles. In this strategy, we designed a novel lockingamplifier which is activated only in the presence of virus by aptamerrecognition. The reaction process was carried out though one-pot method at 37degrees C, which can save time and resources. In addition, magnetic beads used inreaction system can simplify operation, as well as provide ideas for developingbiosensing robots via magnetic field. This SERS aptasensor can detect SARS-CoV-2 virus with a LOD of 260 TU/microL within 40 min in the linear range of 625-10000 TU/microL. Therefore, this convenience, speediness, sensitivity, and selectivity of detection has great prospects in analyzing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles or otherviruses in environment as well as monitoring of environmental virus sources.

LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab007 [doi]
AB  - Vaccination programmes are critically important to suppress the burden ofinfectious diseases, saving countless lives globally, as emphasised by thecurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Effective adaptive immune responses are complexprocesses subject to multiple influences. Recent genetic, pre-clinical, andclinical studies have converged to show that availability of iron is a key factorregulating the development of T and B cell responses to infection andimmunisation. Lymphocytes obtain iron from circulating transferrin. The amount ofiron bound to transferrin is dependent on dietary iron availability and isdecreased during inflammation via upregulation of the iron-regulatory hormone,hepcidin. As iron deficiency and chronic inflammatory states are both globallyprevalent health problems, the potential impact of low iron availability onimmune responses is significant. We describe the evidence supporting theimportance of iron in immunity, highlight important unknowns, and discuss howtherapeutic interventions to modulate iron availability might be implementable inthe context of vaccination and infectious disease.

TI  - Effect of treatment regimens in severe COVID pneumonia at an Indian tertiary carehospital: An observational, real-world study.
LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2022.05.009 [doi]
AB  - Background: Corticosteroids have attracted attention as a treatment option forsevere Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, published data on steroid therapyis debatable, and real-world data is lacking. This study evaluated the effect of treatment regimens, especially Pulse steroid therapy (Injection MethylPrednisolone 250 mg iv once a day for three days) in severe-COVID-19 pneumonia atan Indian tertiary care hospital. Methods: This observational cross-sectionalstudy included severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients aged >18 years, requiringassisted ventilation. As part of the hospital protocol, patients received either pulse steroid therapy, remdesivir or tocilizumab in addition to the recommendedsteroid doses i.e., injection of dexamethasone 6 mg iv once a day. Theassociation of factors and treatment regimens to patient outcomes was evaluated. Results: Data of eighty-three patients were assessed, majority being above 60years (n = 30, 36.14%) and males (n = 45/83, 54.21%). The commonest comorbiditieswere hypertension (n = 26), diabetes (n = 23) and obesity (n = 19), fifty-fivepatients (66.26%) reported at least one comorbidity. Sixty-one patients (73.49%) had received pulse steroid regimen, forty-eight patients (57.83%) wereadministered remdesivir-based regimen while twelve patients (14.46%) had receivedtocilizumab treatment. 54.1% patients managed with pulse steroid regimens weredischarged after treatment, statistically similar to remdesivir-managed subgroup (62.5%, p > 0.05). On sub-group analysis, pulse steroids showed better outcomesin young males with no comorbidities. No comorbidity had significant relationshipwith patient outcomes (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Pulse steroid therapy is aneffective therapy in management of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in areal-world setting, with better outcomes in young males without comorbidities.Pulse steroids can be considered a viable option for severe-COVID-19 pneumoniamanagement.

TI  - COVID-19 infection prediction from CT scan images of lungs using IterativeConvolution Neural Network Model.
PG  - 103214
LID - 10.1016/j.advengsoft.2022.103214 [doi]
AB  - World Health Organization has defined COVID-19 as a contagious, communicable and fast spreading disease engendered by the Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, is arespirational microorganism. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan images of thechest helps in detecting COVID 19 infection in a fast way with much reliability. In this paper, chest CT scan images of COVID and Non-COVID categories areconsidered to train the supervised classifier, Iterative convolution NeuralNetwork. The training process is done with six different training data size. The trained models are iterated for the fixed size of testing data (20 images). Thesame set of training and testing processes are done with two different Iterative Convolutional Neural Network architectures, one with two hidden layers (CNN1) andanother with three hidden layers (CNN2). The iterations are extended up to 7, butthe model performance is degraded after the 6(th) iteration, which makes to fixthe iteration level as 5 for both CNN models. Six different training sets withfive iterations have led into 30 CNN models. For two different CNN architectures,which lead to 60 different models. The model designed with 100 training sets inboth CNN1 and CNN2, have produced the high accuracy in COVID classification than any other models. The better classification accuracy 89% is achieved from CNN2model with its 5(th) iteration.

TI  - Highly private blockchain-based management system for digital COVID-19certificates.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1007/s10207-022-00598-3 [doi]
AB  - As a result of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, several proposals ofblockchain-based solutions for digital COVID-19 certificates have been presented.Considering that health data have high privacy requirements, a health datamanagement system must fulfil several strict privacy and security requirements.On the one hand, confidentiality of the medical data must be assured, being thedata owner (the patient) the actor that maintain control over the privacy oftheir certificates. On the other hand, the entities involved in the generationand validation of certificates must be supervised by a regulatory authority. Thisset of requirements are generally not achieved together in previous proposals.Moreover, it is required that a digital COVID-19 certificate management protocol provides an easy verification process and also strongly avoid the risk offorgery. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a protocol to manage digital COVID-19 certificates where individual users decide how to sharetheir private data in a hierarchical system. In order to achieve this, we puttogether two different technologies: the use of a proxy re-encryption (PRE)service in conjunction with a blockchain-based protocol. Additionally, ourprotocol introduces an authority to control and regulate the centers that cangenerate digital COVID-19 certificates and offers two kinds of validation ofcertificates for registered and non-registered verification entities. Therefore, the paper achieves all the requirements, that is, data sovereignty, high privacy,forgery avoidance, regulation of entities, security and easy verification.

TI  - Severe coronavirus disease 2019 in a patient with TAFRO syndrome: A case report.
PG  - 100158
LID - 10.1016/j.clinpr.2022.100158 [doi]
AB  - Background: TAFRO syndrome, a subtype of idiopathic multicentric Castlemandisease, is an acute or subacute systemic inflammatory disease that causes fever,generalized oedema (pleural effusion or ascites), and thrombocytopenia and isassociated with renal impairment, anaemia, and organomegaly (hepatosplenomegalyand lymph node enlargement). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associatedhyperinflammation is caused by dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.Cytokine storm syndrome is common to both COVID-19 and TAFRO syndrome.Casereport.A 66-year-old man with TAFRO syndrome was admitted because of worseningrenal function, right pleural effusion, and ascites. He was taking 20 mgprednisolone orally and 25 mg cyclosporin A orally twice daily. Despiteadministration of maximum oxygenation and remdesivir, the patient developed acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was transferred to the intensive careunit. Results: Chest radiography showed bilateral lung infiltration. COVID-19 wasconfirmed with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Chest and abdominal computed tomographyshowed massive ground-glass opacities in both lungs, slight right pleuraleffusion, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and ascites. Conclusion: To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first report of COVID-19 in a patient with TAFRO syndrome.Despite receiving a moderate dose of a corticosteroid and a monoclonal antibodyagainst the IL-6 receptor, our patient developed severe pneumonia, suggestingthat strong immunomodulatory therapy in the antiviral phase of COVID-19 maypromote viral growth and induce ARDS.

PG  - 101218
LID - 10.1016/j.jjie.2022.101218 [doi]
AB  - The hospitals in Japan have hitherto had complete autonomy in deciding whether toadmit COVID-19 patients. In fact, they were "swinging" between admitting or notCOVID-19 patients, especially during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. To addressendogenous decision making, we estimated the effect of admitting COVID-19patients on hospital profits using instrumental variable (IV) regression. Wederived the IVs from the guidelines of the national government on which hospital types should admit COVID-19 patients. Our empirical results revealed that themonthly profits per bed decreased by approximately JPY 600,000 ( approximatelyUSD 4615), which is 15 times the average monthly profit in 2019. Thisoverwhelming financial damage indicates it is costly for some hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients because of their low suitability in admitting such patients.Based on the implications of our main results, we propose an alternative strategyto handling patient surges in case of new infectious disease outbreaks.

TI  - Anatomy matters: The role of the subject-specific respiratory tract on aerosoldeposition - A CFD study.
PG  - 115372
LID - 10.1016/j.cma.2022.115372 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges to humanity nowadays.COVID-19 virus can replicate in the host's larynx region, which is in contrast toother viruses that replicate in lungs only, i.e. SARS. This is conjectured tosupport a fast spread of COVID-19. However, there is sparse research in thisfield about quantitative comparison of virus load in the larynx for varyingsusceptible individuals. In this regard the lung geometry itself could influence the risk of reproducing more pathogens and consequently exhaling more virus.Disadvantageously, there are only sparse lung geometries available. To still beable to investigate realistic geometrical deviations we employ three differentdigital replicas of human airways up to the 7 th level of bifurcation,representing two realistic lungs (male and female) as well as a more simplifiedexperimental model. Our aim is to investigate the influence of breathingscenarios on aerosol deposition in anatomically different, realistic humanairways. In this context, we employ three levels of cardiovascular activity aswell as reported experimental particle size distributions by means ofComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with special focus on the larynx region toenable new insights into the local virus loads in human respiratory tracts. Inaddition, the influence of more realistic boundary conditions is investigated by performing transient simulations of a complete respiratory cycle in the upperlung regions of the considered respiratory models, focusing in particular ondeposition in the oral cavity, the laryngeal region, and trachea, whilesimplifying the tracheobronchial tree. The aerosol deposition is modeled viaOpenFOAM(\protect \relax \special {t4ht=(R)}) by employing an Euler-Lagrangianframe including steady and unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)resolved turbulent flow using the k- omega -SST and k- omega -SST DES turbulence models. We observed that the respiratory geometry altered the local depositionpatterns, especially in the laryngeal region. Despite the larynx region, theeffects of varying flow rate for the airway geometries considered were found tobe similar in the majority of respiratory tract regions. For all particle sizedistributions considered, localized particle accumulation occurred in the larynx of all considered lung models, which were more pronounced for larger particlesize distributions. Moreover, it was found, that employing transient simulations instead of steady-state analysis, the overall particle deposition pattern ismaintained, however with a stronger intensity in the transient cases.

TI  - The Role of Diet and Supplements in the Prevention and Progression of COVID-19:Current Knowledge and Open Issues.
PG  - 137-149

AB  - A healthy diet and dietary supplements have gained attention as potentialco-adjuvants in managing and preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thispaper critically reviews the current evidence regarding the impact of diet andsupplements on the prevention and progression of COVID-19. According to availabledata, a healthy diet and normal weight are considered protective factors.Regarding dietary supplementation, the most robust results from human studies arefor vitamin C, which appears to decrease inflammatory markers and suppresscytokine storm. A small, randomized trial showed that a high dose of vitamin Dsignificantly reduced the need for intensive care unit treatment of patientsrequiring hospitalization for COVID-19. According to retrospective human studies,there is limited evidence for vitamin E and selenium supplements. Animal studies have investigated the effects of green tea and curcumin. Xanthohumol andprobiotics, interesting for their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, andimmunoregulatory properties, need formal clinical study. In summary, there ispromising evidence supporting the role of diet and supplements as co-adjuvants inthe treatment of COVID-19. Further studies and properly designed clinical trials are necessary to draw more robust conclusions; however, it is not unreasonable totake a pragmatic approach and promote the use of appropriate diet and supplementsto counter the effects of COVID-19, ideally with a mechanism to assess outcomes.

TI  - Sparse spatially clustered coefficient model via adaptive regularization.
PG  - 107581
LID - 10.1016/j.csda.2022.107581 [doi]
AB  - Large spatial datasets with many spatial covariates have become ubiquitous inmany fields in recent years. A question of interest is to identify whichcovariates are likely to influence a spatial response, and whether and how theeffects of these covariates vary across space, including potential abrupt changesfrom region to region. To solve this question, a new efficient regularizedspatially clustered coefficient (RSCC) regression approach is proposed, whichcould achieve variable selection and identify latent spatially heterogeneouscovariate effects with clustered patterns simultaneously. By carefully designing the regularization term of RSCC as a chain graph guided fusion penalty plus agroup lasso penalty, the RSCC model is computationally efficient for largespatial datasets while still achieving the theoretical guarantees for estimation.RSCC also adopts the idea of adaptive learning to allow for adaptive weights and adaptive graphs in its regularization terms and further improves the estimationperformance. RSCC is applied to study the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines usingcounty-level data in the United States and discover the determinants ofvaccination acceptance with varying effects across counties, revealing important within-state and across-state spatially clustered patterns of covariates effects.

LID - 10.1080/09687599.2021.1960276 [doi]
AB  - America's housing affordability crisis has had various indirect costs on healthand safety among people living with disability. The skyrocketing housing priceshave exponentially increased with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic leaving manypeople at risk for eviction after federal and local moratoriums providingprotection during the pandemic expire. Americans with disabilities have beenparticularly affected by the affordability crisis and it is expected that thismajor public health problem will only grow as government-provided protections andsupports wane. It is critical that both government and various housingorganizations consider ways to support affordability, quality, and accessibility in this particularly hard-hit population.

AB  - The inflammable growth of misinformation on social media and other platformsduring pandemic situations like COVID-19 can cause significant damage to thephysical and mental stability of the people. To detect such misinformation,researchers have been applying various machine learning (ML) and deep learning(DL) techniques. The objective of this study is to systematically review, assess,and synthesize state-of-the-art research articles that have used different ML andDL techniques to detect COVID-19 misinformation. A structured literature searchwas conducted in the relevant bibliographic databases to ensure that the surveywas solely centered on reproducible and high-quality research. We reviewed 43papers that fulfilled our inclusion criteria out of 260 articles found from ourkeyword search. We have surveyed a complete pipeline of COVID-19 misinformationdetection. In particular, we have identified various COVID-19 misinformationdatasets and reviewed different data processing, feature extraction, andclassification techniques to detect COVID-19 misinformation. In the end, thechallenges and limitations in detecting COVID-19 misinformation using MLtechniques and the future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and severedisease among fully vaccinated (FV) individuals with COVID-19. Further, weinvestigated if risk factors for hospitalization and severe disease are similarbetween unvaccinated (UV) and vaccinated individuals. Methods: This was amulticenter, observational cohort analysis from a large regional healthcaresystem in metro Detroit using electronic health record data to evaluate riskfactors for hospitalization and severe COVID-19 disease. Vaccination data wereretrieved using electronic medical records linked to our statewide immunizationdatabase. Consecutive adult FV and UV patients with a primary admission diagnosisof COVID-19 were included in the comparative analysis. Partially vaccinatedpatients and patients who had received a booster dose were excluded. The primary outcome of this study was hospital admission and severe disease inclusive ofintensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results:Between December 15, 2020 and December 19, 2021, 20,584 emergency departmentvisits met our inclusion criteria. Among these, 2005 (9.7%) visits consisted ofFV individuals, 18,579 (90.3%) were UV, and 40.3% of UV and 52.7% of FV required hospitalization with similar (12.7% and 12.6%, respectively) rates of severedisease. Hospitalized UV patients with severe disease were younger than their FV counterparts (49.5% <65 years vs. 13.5% p < 0.001). Risk factors for severedisease on UV and FV included age >/=65 years (UV: adjusted odds ratio [aOR]1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.73, p < 0.001 and FV: aOR 2.50, 95% CI 1.44-4.36 p = 0.001) and weighted Elixhauser score >10 (UV: aOR 9.11, 95% CI6.92-12.00, p < 0.001 and FV: aOR 6.04, 95% CI 2.68-13.26, p < 0.001). However,only on UV status, body mass index (BMI) >/=30 kg/m(2) was associated withincreased odds of severe disease (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 2.09-3.22, p < 0.001).Conclusions: FV patients with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection who requirehospitalization and have severe disease are older and have more medicalcomorbidities compared to UV patients. When comparing risk factors for severedisease between UV and FV individuals, FV status is particularly associated with reduced risk among patients with a BMI >/=30 kg/m(2) and a moderate number ofmedical comorbidities, regardless of age, highlighting the importance ofvaccination in these particularly vulnerable groups.

TI  - A customized early warning score enhanced emergency department patient flowprocess and clinical outcomes in a COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - e12783
LID - 10.1002/emp2.12783 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Patient crowding and boarding in the emergency department (ED) isassociated with adverse outcomes and has become increasingly problematic inrecent years. We investigated the impact of an ED patient flow countermeasureusing an early warning score. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis ofobservational data from patients who presented to the ED of a Level 1 TraumaCenter in Pennsylvania. We implemented a modified version of the Modified EarlyWarning Score (MEWS), called mMEWS, to address patient flow. Patients aged >/=18 years old admitted to the adult hospital medicine service were included in thestudy. We compared the pre-mMEWS (February 19, 2017-February 18, 2019) to thepost-mMEWS implementation period (February 19, 2019-June 30, 2020). During theintervention, low MEWS (0-1) scoring admissions went directly to the inpatientfloor with expedited orders, the remainder waited in the ED until the hospitalmedicine admitting team evaluated the patient and then placed orders. Weinvestigated the association between mMEWS, ED length of stay (LOS), and 24-hour rapid response team (24 hour-RRT) activation. RRT activation rates were used as ameasure of adverse outcome for the new process and are a network team responsefor admitted patients who are rapidly decompensating. The association betweenmMEWS and the outcomes of ED length of stay in minutes and 24 hour-RRT activationwas assessed using linear and logistic regression adjusting for a priori selectedconfounders, respectively. Results: Of the total 43,892 patients admitted, 19,962(45.5%) were in the pre-mMEWS and 23,930 (54.5%) in the post-mMEWS implementationperiod. The median post-mMEWS ED LOS was shorter than the pre-mMEWS (376 vs 415minutes; P < 0.01). After accounting for potential confounders, there was a 4.57%decrease in the ED LOS after implementing mMEWS (95% confidence interval [CI],4.20-4.94; P < 0.01). The proportion of 24 hour-RRT did not differ significantly when comparing pre- and post-mMEWS (33.5% vs 34.4%; P = 0.83). Conclusion: Theuse of a modified MEWS enhanced admission process to the hospital medicineservice, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, was associated with a significantdecrease in ED LOS without a significant increase in 24 hour-RRT activation.

LID - 10.46234/ccdcw2022.135 [doi]
AB  - What is already known about this topic?: China was certified malaria-free on June30, 2021. However, imported malaria continuously threatens the effort to prevent re-establishment of malaria in China. What is added by this report?: Measuressuch as international travel restrictions, entry quarantine, and screening infever clinics during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period wereassociated with a significant decrease of imported malaria cases in AnhuiProvince, a higher proportion of non-Plasmodium falciparum (non-P. falciparum)malaria reported infections, and a higher proportion of cases requiring medicalattention at their initial visit. What are the implications for public healthpractices?: It is necessary to be vigilant about imported malaria during theCOVID-19 epidemic, especially for non-P. falciparum infections which are moredifficult to detect, and to promote research, development, and introduction ofmore sensitive and specific point-of-care detection methods for non-P. falciparumspecies.

TI  - Adapting parent-focused interventions for diverse caregivers of children withintellectual and developmental disabilities: Lessons learned during globalcrises.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - Parent-focused interventions have been designed to provide training and supportto caregivers who are essential in achieving positive outcomes for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). In 2020, significant crises,including the COVID-19 pandemic and continued racial tensions, profoundlyimpacted the livelihood of children with IDD and their families. Many ongoingefforts to address disparities among this population were halted temporarily and required further adaptations. Researchers adapted interventions and support toaddress the disparities impacting children with IDD and their families withlimited guidance. We provide a descriptive case analysis of four parent-focusedinterventions that responded to the global crises to continue serving childrenwith IDD and their families. The four distinct programs were based on appliedbehavior analysis and naturalistic, developmental-behavioral paradigms that were culturally adapted for families of young children with IDD from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. We present the qualitative reports on thechallenges and benefits that arose with adapting the four parent-focusedinterventions for telehealth implementation. We focused specifically onadaptations made in recruitment and retention, instrumentation and measurement,research staff training, and intervention delivery. We synthesize our experience with challenges and solutions in adapting parent-focused interventions forracially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children with IDD and theirfamilies. We conclude with recommendations for researchers and practitioners onmethods for adapting parent-focused interventions to address the significanthealth disparities that impact racially, ethnically, and socioeconomicallydiverse children with IDD and their families.

PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1007/s10734-022-00886-w [doi]
AB  - Feeling part of a community of learners has been shown to foster students'engagement and sense of belonging, leading to higher retention and achievement oflearning outcomes. The pivot to online teaching caused by the COVID-19 pandemichas prompted a reappraisal of all aspects of the student experience, includingstudents' capacity and opportunity to engage in meaningful learning communitiesonline. There has been some emergent literature which considers how to facilitateonline learning communities in the emergency remote teaching context prompted by COVID-19. However, there is a notable lack of literature which considers howlearning communities are defined, understood, and negotiated by students in this unique teaching context. Given how students' perceptions of learning communities contributes to Higher Education policy (e.g. through the National StudentSurvey), this is important to understand. In the present study (N = 309), wequalitatively investigated students' understanding and definition of the term"learning community" during a time of emergency pivot to online teaching andlearning. A reflexive thematic analysis of students' first-hand responsesgenerated three dominant themes: "Feeling connected: Bridging the gap whilstphysically distanced", "Feeling included: Visible and valued", and "Feelingtogether: Mutuality and the shared experience". We discuss the implications forthese conceptualisations of an online learning community and suggest ways forwardfor Higher Education pedagogy.

AB  - Glycyrrhizic acid and its primary metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid, are the mainactive ingredients in the licorice roots (glycyrrhiza species), which are widely used in several countries of the world, especially in east asian countries(China, Japan). These ingredients and their derivatives play an important role intreating many diseases, especially infectious diseases such as COVID-19 andhepatic infections. This review aims to summarize the different ways ofsynthesising the amide derivatives of glycyrrhizic acid and the main ways tosynthesize the glycyrrhitinic acid derivatives. Also, to determine the mainbiological and pharmacological activity for these compounds from the previousstudies to provide essential data to researchers for future studies.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary materialavailable at 10.1134/S1068162022050132.

TI  - Perception of Older Thai Adults in a Do-Not-Attempt Resuscitation Order duringthe COVID-19 Era If Infected with COVID-19.
PG  - 107-115
LID - 10.1089/pmr.2021.0084 [doi]
AB  - Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, older adultsexperienced high mortality rates, and their deaths were often preceded by sudden health deterioration and acute respiratory failure. This prompted older adultsand their families to make rapid goals-of-care decisions. Objective: This studyaimed at determining the prevalence of and factors associated withCOVID-19-related do-not-attempt resuscitation (DNR) decisions among older adults.Design: This was a cross-sectional population-based survey. Setting: Well-lookingactive (mobile) community-dwelling adults aged >/=60 years and residing in theBangkok district, Thailand, between April and May 2020, were included in thisstudy. We excluded older adults who (1) were unable to speak Thai, (2) had severecognitive impairment, or (3) were blind or deaf. We interviewed participantsabout their perceptions regarding end-of-life decisions in case they got infectedwith COVID-19 and experienced respiratory arrest. Results: We recruited 848participants with a mean age of 70.5 (+/-6.74) years. When asked about theirchoice, 49.8% chose a DNR status, 44.5% chose full life support, and 5.8% wereundecided. The three most common reasons provided by the DNR group for theirchoice were old age (54.9%), acceptance of death (15.6%), and fear of pain(8.5%). Conclusion: Almost half of the older Thai adults chose a DNR status forscenarios in which they were infected with COVID-19 and suffered from cardiacarrest during the pandemic period. Future studies should include an in-depthexamination of participants' lifestyles, family life expectancy, and religiousfaith to understand their end-of-life decisions.

AB  - Background: With the rapid progress of medical technology, the number of childrenwith medical complexities who require advanced medical care, including mechanicalventilators, has been increasing steadily in Japan. Accordingly, the issue of howto provide holistic care and support for the entire life of the children withsevere motor and intellectual disabilities (SMID) who live at home has become anew challenge. Case Presentation: We present the case of a three-year-old boywith SMID due to HHV-6B-induced hemorrhagic shock encephalopathy who was caredfor at home by the home visit medical team of Osaka Developmental Rehabilitation Center (ODRC; residential facilities with the department of home medicaltreatment and care). He developed septic shock triggered by an urinary tractinfection and was admitted to Osaka General Medical Center (OGMC; acute carefacility not directly affiliated with ODRC), where he deteriorated to a terminal stage. After discussing advance care planning (ACP) with his parents, along with the medical team, an ACP document with parental wishes was created throughcollaboration between the two facilities. The document was approved by the EthicsCommittee at OGMC and the parents signed the document. Special end-of-life careplanning was given by nurses at OGMC based on the best interests of the patientand the family. The patient passed away peacefully surrounded by his family in a private room of OGMC according to the ACP, despite special limitations caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Conclusions: ACP provides agood opportunity to think about the best total care for a child with SMID, forwhom it is too difficult to express his or her wishes, together with the parents,who are the legal representatives. The collaboration between two institutionswith different roles brought out the best of each, and the resulting ACP wasbeneficial to the patient and their family.

AB  - A novel series of fused pyrazolo[5',1':2,3]imidazo[1,5-c]quinazolin-6(5H)-oneswere synthesized and their affinity against the COVID-19 main protease wasinvestigated using molecular docking study and compared to that of some usedstandard clinical drugs. These compounds were obtained in good to excellentyields from 63 to 91% in the presence of 30 mol% catalyst in ethanol at refluxfor 2 h through an efficient one-pot three-component reaction including anintramolecular rearrangement and a cyclization through intramolecularnucleophilic reaction. The results of in silico studies showed thatelectronegativity, resonance effects, hydrophobic interaction, halogen andhydrogen bonding had significant effects on the performance of these compounds asan inhibitor ligand. Also, these results indicated the proper affinity of thesecompounds against the COVID-19 main protease with excellent binding energies(especially 4r = -8.77, 4q = -8.73 and 4m = -8.63) in comparison to remdesivir,chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir drugs.

TI  - ALD based nanostructured zinc oxide coated antiviral silk fabric.
PG  - 19327-19339
LID - 10.1039/d2ra02653h [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of research and development in maintaining public health. Facing unprecedented challenges, the scientificcommunity developed antiviral drugs, virucides, and vaccines to combat theinfection within the past two years. However, an ever-increasing list of highlyinfectious SARS-CoV-2 variants (gamma, delta, omicron, and now ba.2 stealth) has exacerbated the problem: again raising the issues of infection preventionstrategies and the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE). Against this backdrop, we report an antimicrobial fabric for PPE applications. We havefabricated a nanofibrous silk-PEO material using electrospinning followed by zincoxide thin film deposition by employing the atomic layer deposition technique.The composite fabric has shown 85% more antibacterial activity than the controlfabric and was found to possess substantial superoxide dismutase-mimeticactivity. The composite was further subjected to antiviral testing using twodifferent respiratory tract viruses: coronavirus (OC43: enveloped) and rhinovirus(RV14: non-enveloped). We report a 95% reduction in infectious virus for bothOC43 and RV14 from an initial load of approximately 1 x 10(5) (sample size: 6 mm dia. disk), after 1 h of white light illumination. Furthermore, with 2 h ofillumination, approximately 99% reduction in viral infectivity was observed forRV14. High activity in a relatively small area of fabric (3.5 x 10(3) viral unitsper mm(2)) makes this antiviral fabric ideal for application in masks/PPE, withan enhanced ability to prevent antimicrobial infection overall.

AB  - COVID-19 has been one of the common infections that have affected numerouschildren across the world in the last two years. The clinical manifestations ofthis virus are varied, ranging from being asymptomatic to affecting multipleorgan systems. There is a lot of ongoing research to find out the differentmanifestations that this infection can have in both adults and children. As with any viral illness, skin is one of the most commonly affected organs, and manyviral illnesses can present with a rash. In our case, we found it interestingthat our patient who tested positive for COVID-19 had a rash that began on theday of her initial presentation and evolved over time as the disease progressed, and hence, we thought it was important to highlight this rare case presentationas a cutaneous finding in children with COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Scarcity and panic buying: the effect of regulation by subsidizing the supply andcustomer purchases during a crisis.
PG  - 1-26
LID - 10.1007/s10479-022-04837-7 [doi]
AB  - During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in France, people cleared theshelves of butter; in Italy, it was pasta; in Great Britain, it was chicken.While there may be cultural disagreement on what is essential, clearly, in times of crisis, consumers stockpile the 'essentials'. We address the problem of "panicbuying", which is characterized by increasing demand in the face of diminishinginventory. In such cases, prices may hike and firms (retailers) selling thehigh-demand product are quantity takers, in terms of supply, and price setters.We consider a manufacturer who sells a scarce product to a single retailer. Theretailer seeks to maximize her profit, while in contrast, the manufacturerpursues a social objective of regulating and lowering the amount that the endcustomer (consumer) pays (including the cost of traveling to obtain the scarceproduct). By analyzing the competition between the two parties, retailer andmanufacturer, we find that even when the regulator (manufacturer) makes asignificant social commitment, neither subsidizing the retailer nor subsidizingthe consumers necessarily curbs price hikes. Furthermore, there is a thresholdratio (i.e., proportion of the end price subsidized by the regulator) thatdetermines the minimal budget that the regulator would need to allocate in order for subsidization to make a difference to consumers.

TI  - Early recognition and treatment of pre-VITT syndrome after adenoviralvector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may prevent from thrombotic complications:review of published cases and clinical pathway.
PG  - oeac036
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac036 [doi]
AB  - Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but highlymorbid complication after adenoviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Thepre-VITT syndrome is defined as vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia withoutthrombosis typically presenting with new-onset headache. This review aims toidentify at-risk patients before complications such as cerebral venous sinusthrombosis occur. We review previously published reports of 19 patients (medianage 35 years, range 23-74; 16 females) who met the diagnostic criteria for apre-VITT syndrome. Seven patients progressed to VITT, 12 patients did not.Patients who experienced VITT received delayed treatment. The median intervalbetween the onset of headache and VITT-treatment (i.e. anticoagulation, immuneglobulins, or corticosteroids) was 5 days (range 1-8 days) compared with 2 days(0-5 days) in those without subsequent VITT (P = 0.033). The interval from onset of headache to anticoagulation was longer in patients with VITT (median 7 vs. 2days; range 3-9 vs. 0-7 days; P = 0.01). Anticoagulation was safe in all patientswith a pre-VITT syndrome as no haemorrhagic complications occurred afteranticoagulation was started despite low platelets. The transient decline ofplatelet count after admission was significantly more pronounced in patients who progressed to VITT (median 67 vs. 0 x 10(3)/microL; range 0-77 x 10(3)/microL vs.0-10 x 10(3)/microL; P = 0.005). d-dimers did not differ between groups. Pre-VITTsyndrome is a 'red flag' and allows to identify and preemptively treat patientsat-risk of further progression to VITT. However, it must be distinguished frompost-vaccination immune thrombocytopenia.
